(AURA) operates several observatory centers (including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the National Solar Observatory, and the Gemini Observatory)
in the United States and Chile under cooperative agreements with the National Science Foundation.


The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Project is currently constructing an 8.4 meter diameter ground-based observatory in Chile and a 3.2 gigapixel camera with funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. The telescope
will survey the visible sky every few nights in six optical bands to address four key science themes: Constraining the nature of dark energy and dark matter, making an inventory of small moving bodies in the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky,
and determining the accretion history of the Milky Way.


Determining the optimal observing strategy to simultaneously achieve the multiple science goals is performed via a complex scheduling algorithm - the “Scheduler”. The Scheduler is the brain of the LSST survey and is now in construction as part of the Telescope
and Site (T&S;) group. LSST is designed to conduct a sequence of “visits”, each covering ~ 10 square degrees of sky, and consisting of two consecutive 15s exposures. The Scheduler will determine the sequence of visits on any given night, i.e. the locations
of the successive telescope pointings on the sky and the choice of filter for each pointing, taking explicit account of observing conditions and the history of visits to date. The various scientific objectives place different constraints on the Scheduler,
and the overall optimization will require a definition of those constraints, a specification of how they should be quantified and measured, and the construction of an efficient scheduling code to implement them.


The job of the LSST Survey Scientist is to lead the development and optimization of the Scheduler.


Essential functions include:

Ensuring the delivery of a scheduler that meets its technical requirements and LSST scientific goals, working closely with the Scheduler developer(s), the LSST simulations team, and the scientific community.
Leading a Scheduler verification process during the Telescope and Site Integration and Test phase.
Managing the construction of the Scheduler development with the OCS manager, evaluating potential cost and schedule impacts of proposed requirement changes motivated by community input.
Leading analyses of the scientific impact on the LSST survey resulting from changes in scheduling algorithms, scheduling parameters, observatory constraints and environmental conditions, as well as changes in science proposals.
Interfacing with the relevant stakeholders in T&S; team and the Project Science Team as well as the scientific community.
Maintaining an active scientific interest in selected scientific investigations enabled by LSST and publishing in refereed journals
The Survey Scientist will be a member of the T&S; group, based primarily in Tucson, AZ. He/she is expected to collaborate closely with the T&S; Project Scientist, the Scheduler Developer and the LSST simulations team. Some travel to La Serena, Chile will also
be required, especially during the period when the LSST undergoes integration and test, and commissioning. The Survey Scientist will report to the LSST Director, but will take direction from the T&S; Project Manager and the T&S; Project Scientist."

About Tucson
Tucson is truly a city with personality, heart and soul - all accompanied with a blended mixture of sounds and rhythms. While its roots go back to the beginning of recorded history, Tucson has a young, dynamic population and is just large enough to offer the perks of a big city and small enough to be friendly and welcoming!
Located in the Southwest United States, Tucson is set in a Sonoran Desert valley surrounded by five mountain ranges. Boasting an average 350 sunny days a year and warm dry air, Tucson’s climate is ideal for year-round outdoor recreation. Winter temperatures average highs of 64-75 °F. With a population of more than 1 million; Tucson is now the second-largest city in Arizona after the state capital Phoenix.

About Tucson
Tucson is truly a city with personality, heart and soul - all accompanied with a blended mixture of sounds and rhythms. While its roots go back to the beginning of recorded history, Tucson has a young, dynamic population and is just large enough to offer the perks of a big city and small enough to be friendly and welcoming!
Located in the Southwest United States, Tucson is set in a Sonoran Desert valley surrounded by five mountain ranges. Boasting an average 350 sunny days a year and warm dry air, Tucson’s climate is ideal for year-round outdoor recreation. Winter temperatures average highs of 64-75 °F. With a population of more than 1 million; Tucson is now the second-largest city in Arizona after the state capital Phoenix.
Money magazine recently ranked Tucson as the fifth ""most livable"" medium-sized city in the West. Because of its casual, welcoming atmosphere, Tucson was included in the book 50 Fabulous Places to Raise Your Family (Career Press). In addition Tucson schools are rated as ""excellent"" and its employment outlook is described as ""one of the fastest-growing job markets in the U.S."" The abundance and low price of land continues to provide Tucsonans with a wide range of housing styles and communities. Based on cost of living indexes, housing is far more affordable here than in many areas in the country.

Now one of the top twenty research universities in the nation, the University of Arizona was established in Tucson in 1885. In areas as diverse as astronomy, medicine, optics, entrepreneurship, and dance, UA faculty and programs are among the nation's best. Tucsonans proudly support the UA's Wildcat teams that compete in NCAA Division I and PAC – 12 Conference athletics and have won many championships.

The Department provides students with a quality education and prepares students with the ability to provide quality chemical analysis through various analytical methods and instrumentations. In addition, the Chemistry Program serves as a solid foundation for the matriculation into graduate or professional schools. The Department is equipped with many state-of-the-art separation, spectroscopic, imaging and other analytical instrumentation. Furthermore, the Department houses the Planetarium and Observatory, which had a record-setting attendance during the most recent academic year, with about 5000 visitors from grade schools, churches, youth centers, summer campus and day care centers. Primary Purpose of the Position: The FSU Planetarium and Observatory, which are housed in the Department of Chemistry and Physics, receive about 5,000 visitors annually from K-12 schools, community settings (e.g., churches, senior centers, youth centers etc.), summer campus and day care centers. The FSU Planetarium and Observatory shows and activities are designed to ignite a spark of interest in the visitors, especially in K-12 school students that will lead some of them to pursue a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degree at FSU. With renovation in Planetarium (new digital projector, renovated inside, improved seating capacity etc.) and in Observatory (new telescopes and renovation of the space), and addition of a Mini Science Center in the first floor of LS building (LS 102), they can be two most-visited attraction sites in Fayetteville. Currently, the Planetarium and Observatory is being directed by a full-time chemistry faculty member without any release time. The Planetarium and Observatory shows are planned according to his teaching, research, and service schedules and thus these two assets are not being utilized in their full capacities. With a full-time Lecturer/Planetarium Manager, we are very confident the annual number of visitors (especially elementary/middle/high school students) to these two sites can easily be tripled, even quadrupled, and will increase the number of individuals who come to FSU to earn STEM degrees. Therefore, this position is very important for outreach activities recruitment to STEM majors at FSU.

(AURA) operates several observatory centers (including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the National Solar Observatory, and the Gemini Observatory)
in the United States and Chile under cooperative agreements with the National Science Foundation.


The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Project is currently constructing an 8.4 meter diameter ground-based observatory in Chile and a 3.2 gigapixel camera with funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. The telescope
will survey the visible sky every few nights in six optical bands to address four key science themes: Constraining the nature of dark energy and dark matter, making an inventory of small moving bodies in the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky,
and determining the accretion history of the Milky Way.


Determining the optimal observing strategy to simultaneously achieve the multiple science goals is performed via a complex scheduling algorithm - the “Scheduler”. The Scheduler is the brain of the LSST survey and is now in construction as part of the Telescope
and Site (T&S;) group. LSST is designed to conduct a sequence of “visits”, each covering ~ 10 square degrees of sky, and consisting of two consecutive 15s exposures. The Scheduler will determine the sequence of visits on any given night, i.e. the locations
of the successive telescope pointings on the sky and the choice of filter for each pointing, taking explicit account of observing conditions and the history of visits to date. The various scientific objectives place different constraints on the Scheduler,
and the overall optimization will require a definition of those constraints, a specification of how they should be quantified and measured, and the construction of an efficient scheduling code to implement them.


The job of the LSST Survey Scientist is to lead the development and optimization of the Scheduler.


Essential functions include:

Ensuring the delivery of a scheduler that meets its technical requirements and LSST scientific goals, working closely with the Scheduler developer(s), the LSST simulations team, and the scientific community.
Leading a Scheduler verification process during the Telescope and Site Integration and Test phase.
Managing the construction of the Scheduler development with the OCS manager, evaluating potential cost and schedule impacts of proposed requirement changes motivated by community input.
Leading analyses of the scientific impact on the LSST survey resulting from changes in scheduling algorithms, scheduling parameters, observatory constraints and environmental conditions, as well as changes in science proposals.
Interfacing with the relevant stakeholders in T&S; team and the Project Science Team as well as the scientific community.
