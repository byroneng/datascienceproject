Memorial Hermann IRONMAN Sports Medicine Institute


The Memorial Hermann IRONMAN Sports Medicine Institute is a comprehensive sports medicine clinic providing elite care for athletes of all ages and skill levels. The institute is based in Houston, Texas, serving the community with locations in the world-renowned Texas Medical Center, Memorial City Medical Center, and The Woodlands. The Institute brings together highly trained experts in sports science, orthopedics, orthopedic surgery, sports physical therapy, human performance, strength and conditioning and sport nutrition to help athletes of all ages and abilities prevent injury, recover from injury and improve performance to reach their personal athletic goals. The Institute offers comprehensive human performance testing services as well. In May 2011, Memorial Hermann and World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) formed a unique collaboration to create The Memorial Hermann IRONMAN Sports Medicine Institute. The two organizations first worked together in 2010 with the introduction of the Memorial Hermann IRONMAN 70.3 Texas in Galveston. The following year, they presented the state's first ultra-distance IRONMAN event, Memorial Hermann IRONMAN Texas, in The Woodlands. The Memorial Hermann Sports Medicine Institute's top-level clinical expertise coupled with the WTC's extensive knowledge of endurance training and recovery not only helps injured athletes in sports like track and field, basketball and football return to their sport faster, but it can also help strong athletes become even stronger. The IRONMAN Sports Medicine Institute collaboration includes cross-sport research on human performance, injury prevention and injury recovery. Orthopedic research protocols examine endurance athletes to determine how their preparation and training regimens might benefit athletes in all sports, including football, soccer and baseball.
