We have the power to move the world.


At AAM, were looking for associates who push boundaries and drive solutions for the future. Innovators. Thinkers. Dreamers. Doers. No matter the role or function, every associate is a piece of what makes AAM great. Weâre growing and building #TeamAAM to be the best. Join us!


The 3 primary deliverables of AAM Product Engineering are:


Design (Blueprints, product specifications, marked prints, new concepts, etc.)
Validate (DVP&Rs;, Test Orders, customer Test Reports, limit test parts, etc.)
Release (PIM activities, Cost Requests, deviation documentation {Permits, PCRs}, etc.

The roles & responsibilities of the Validation Engineer will evolve to best meet the needs of the organization. These roles & responsibilities will include:

Customer Test Reports: AAM Test Engineers are responsible for writing internal level test reports that contain the basic test result data. These reports are not suitable for the customer for many reasons. For instance, they often include data on set-up parts, fixture issues, and test runs with malfunctions. The internal reports do not make conclusions to test results or how they compare to customer requirements. The customer level test reports need to present a clear picture of the test conditions, part level, & failure mode. It will tie the test run to the customer level requirement and present conclusions regarding the acceptability of the test results.
DVP&Rs;: During a program, the DVP&Rs; are a living document with results being added, timing updates, test additions, etc. The AAM Validation Engineer will be the primary keeper of the DVP&R.; He will work with the Application and Test Engineers to plan and prioritize the testing. The main priority will be a thorough validation of the design, but the Validation Engineer will also be tasked with reducing the cost and lead time of the validation plan.
Test Orders: The AAM Validation Engineer will work with the AAM Application Engineers to develop a plan for writing Test Orders. At the completion of a Test Order, it is often standard procedure to write a CML Materials Lab request to document the sampleâs material & its failure mode. In addition to the CML, additional post-test information such as detailed photos or NVH qualification may be required.
DCLA (Duty Cycle Life Analysis): Currently, the AAM Test Engineers perform the DCLAs but there is no consistent reporting of conclusion linking a DCLA to a particular Test Order, particular set of Road Load Data, and a particular customer requirement. The AAM Validation Engineer will be responsible for making these connections and presenting clear concise documentation supporting conclusions.
Program Role & Scope: The AAM Validation Engineer will be responsible for validation on multiple parts on a particular program. For example, on the Zeta program, the Validation Engineer will be responsible for the validation on the 195 mm and 218 mm RDMs as well as the 165 mm Front Drive Unit. The Validation will need to ensure consistency in tests and methods across the programâs products. The Validation Engineer will also help to determine the standard tests that will be used to validate different axle components as revisions occur during the program.
Validation Prototypes: The AAM Validation Engineer will assist with prototype builds with particular emphasis on the prototypes that will be used for validation. It is extremely important to document the prototype material that is tested. In some cases the validation testing may include limit samples. In others, the dimensional or metallurgical state of the test samples will need to be documented internally or in customer reports.
Test Development: Sometimes it is necessary to develop a new test during a program. Sometimes unique tests are required to be developed to replicate conditions or events seen during vehicle usage. They can also be driven by specific customer requirements.
Road Load Data Acquisition (RLDA) & Analysis: The AAM Validation Engineer will be involved in determining the vehicle data to be acquired as well as the interpretation and adjustments required to the data once it is available.
Supplier Component Testing: Supplier component testing such as will be conducted on seals, bushings, bearings, lube, clutch plates, and gaskets will require oversight & tracking as part of the overall test plan. This also applies to fastener testing which may be performed at a suppler or by an AAM Fastener Engineer.
PRTS Response & Customer Validation: The total validation plan includes testing & evaluation at both AAM and the customer. The AAM Validation Engineer will support customer validation which will include responding to test incidents or PRTS issues. Investigation into part usage and test conditions at the time of the incident will be required as well as participation in the post test tear-down, root cause determination, corrective actions, and writing the PRTS response for Application Engineer review.

About Our Team


The Hydrogen and Materials Science Department provides expertise to both Sandia and the Nation on the interaction of hydrogen (and its isotopes) with all types of materials. The Department performs scientific and engineering research to develop fundamental understanding on the aging of materials in gaseous environments, including hydrogen, and applies this understanding to determine its effects on the performance and reliability of materials relevant to Sandiaâs nuclear weapons and energy missions. Department staff conducts research and development primarily for two important customers: 1) Gas Transfer Systems (GTS) for the Nation's Nuclear Weapons Enterprise; and 2) the Fuel Cell Technologies Office (FCTO), part of DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The Departmentâs work covers a broad range of areas, including analyzing hydrogenâs long-term impact on materials used in fuel cell and gas transfer systems, developing solar thermochemical technology for hydrogen production, assessing the suitability of materials for hydrogen storage, advising hydrogen safety codes and standards, maintaining and enhancing nationally recognized core and enabling capabilities in hydrogen science, and initiating hydrogen storage and fuel cell market transformation strategies to bring technological advancements towards broad-based commercial availability.
