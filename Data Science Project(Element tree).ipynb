    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "We the authors of this project will be graduating in near future. Thus we need to look for jobs in our respective fields (which in our case is Mechanical Engineering and Atmospheric Sciences) or continue academics in a well-informed direction for better job opportunities. In either case a comperhensive analysis of the job market depicting trends and classifications can be really benificial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation for this project comes from some obstacles encounterd in the job search, some of which we have tried to elaborate here. Though there are many job search websites which provide a plethora of information about jobs available, one can not draw useful conclusions about the job market such as density of reasearch and development jobs for a mechanical engineer in medical device sector in state of Utah, without analysis of that information. In addition to that, job openings in most of the industries related to Mechanical Engineering are requirement oriented and have very short lead times for joining thus it would be interesting to see if there are any trends in job openings and use the information to benefit the job seekers to decide when to graduate. These are just few queries among other problems we intend to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more aspect of this project includes classification of jobs according to job function and sector, which will help an aspiring Graduate student to take an informed decision to select an area of interest (such as designing, manufacturing, robotics, energy systems).  "

    "\n",
    "In addition to APIs, we will keep html scraping as an option. An html of a typical job search website has list of jobs and their links. A dataframe will be created by extracting the information about the jobs from the html page and from nested url links. We will use beautifulsoup and CSS selectors for this purpose. We expect much of the effort to be in data extraction and especially in data clean up because information about the jobs entered may not follow same format most of the times as it is entered by different users. We will be using classification methods to classify the jobs by the desired metrics (ie. degree requirement). Also we need to filter out the features which are out of our present scope of study."
