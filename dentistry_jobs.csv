Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether.

Franklin College
Founded in 1834, Franklin College provides a liberal arts and sciences education that
fosters independent thinking, innovation, leadership and action for ever-changing
professions and a globally connected world. With an emphasis on engaged learning
opportunities, Franklin offers a Bachelor of Arts degree in more than 50 majors and a
Master of Science degree in athletic training. A second Master’s of Science degree in
physician assistant studies is scheduled to begin in 2019.


Franklin College is proud to be part of Greater Indianapolis and values collaboration
benefiting communities and inspiring students. Students enjoy the comfort and safety of
suburban living, while also experiencing the many opportunities Indianapolis has to offer.


It is noteworthy that Franklin began admitting women in 1842, thereby becoming
Indiana’s first coeducational institution and the seventh in the nation; that spirit of
inclusiveness still characterizes the college today.


Professional and leadership development, as well as civic engagement, are strategically
integrated into departmental and liberal arts curricula and require students to connect
theory with practice beyond the walls of the traditional classroom. In 2007, the Franklin
College faculty reaffirmed their commitment to the liberal arts ideals by endorsing
a new curriculum, “Opening a World of Possibilities” which emphasizes three core
competencies: interacting with the world, experiencing the world and understanding the
world.


Ninety-five percent of Franklin graduates are employed or attending graduate school
within six months of their graduation. Franklin College is exceptionally proud that 83
percent of its graduates applying for medical school since 1981 have been accepted, more
than 1.5 times the national rate. Other students are regularly accepted into graduate
programs for law, education and optometry/dentistry.

Christ Community Health Services' mission is: to provide high quality healthcare to the underserved in the context of distinctively Christian service, recognizing that Jesus Christ is the true healer of individuals and their communities and the source of CCHS' ability to serve.
Christ Community Health Services was founded in 1995 to utilize the provision of care as a tangible demonstration of the love, grace and mercy of Christ. These works are intended to engender transformation in the lives of individuals, families and communities served.
Over the first nine years it continued to grow by adding clinics in low income, underserved neighborhoods. In 2014 the founders and a number of medical team members resigned over philosophical differences. An interim CEO was appointed to bring stability and regain momentum. During 2015 another clinic was added, bringing the total to seven. Now, as the interim CEO has elected to step aside, the new CEO is needed who will provide leadership and build on the current positive momentum.
Christ Community is one of the largest Christian Health Centers in the nation and the largest healthcare provider in Shelby County, Tennessee. Combined, CCHS health centers serve over 57,000 patients with over 162,000 patient visits annually. At each of the seven clinics, CCHS staff works with patients and the community to actively address health issues and spiritual needs within the areas served while serving as a resource for health education and community support. Christ Community strives to maintain visibility within the communities through consistent involvement in community based civic and religious organizations.
The scope of services includes adult and pediatric primary care, behavioral health, women's health, general dentistry, HIV care and treatment, pharmacy, spiritual health, and more. The service model is community based, thereby moderating transportation issues as a barrier to quality healthcare. This commitment to community service is a core principle for CCHS. Being embedded in the communities in which they serve, each center takes on a bit of the flavor of the neighborhood.
Christ Community Health Services is a Federally Qualified Health Center and partner with multiple community and religious organizations serving Memphis. The budgeted headcount is 380 and the budgeted revenue is $30,650,000.
Responsibilities

Consistent with the wishes of the Board of Directors, the CEO is responsible for providing strategic direction, goals, objectives, tactical initiatives and operating policies and practices that will enable CCHS to fulfill its stated Vision and Mission. The CEO along with his/her key leadership team will continually monitor relevant trends in the marketplace and brief the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee on any developments that have the potential of materially impacting CCHS' operations. With the leadership team, the CEO will annually review and refresh CCHS' strategic plan and engage in a thorough review at least triennially.
The CEO along with other key CCHS leaders will maintain strong working relationships with city and county governments, providers and community partners who share CCHS' values and objectives. CCHS seeks to grow and expand its service to the underserved. This requires the collective energies of all like-minded persons and organizations. The CEO's passion for service will be apparent internally, in the community, in the state, and in the faith-based service field nationally.
The CEO will adhere to all of the governance duties as outlined by the Board and the bylaws of the organization. He/she will provide timely operational reviews and reports. He/she will exhibit transparency in decision-making and reporting of results. He/she will always work within prescribed scope of authority.
The CEO will ensure short-and long-term financial viability by pursuing appropriate funding avenues. In partnership with the Chief Development Officer and other members of the leadership team, the CEO will speak on behalf of CCHS to enhance public awareness. He/she will establish strong relationships with community philanthropic organizations. Along with the CFO, he/she will produce timely and accurate financial reports at regular Board meetings and for grantors and funding agencies.
The CEO, with other key persons, will establish strong relationships with the Federal Bureau of Primary Health Care and the TennCare Bureau.
The CEO is responsible for ensuring that CCHS is operating in a way that optimizes the effective and efficient use of human, capital, and physical resources. With the support of staff resources and key leaders, the CEO will ensure that service and quality standards are set for patient care and operational excellence. He/she will approve procedures and practices that will ensure consistently high performance.
The CEO will be a visible member of the CCHS team. He/she will be present in the centers. He/she will be accessible to all CCHS employees. Because of CCHS' community-based structure, it is important that the CEO understand the City of Memphis and the differences and relationships between the neighborhoods served.
The CEO will ensure that staff members are continually enhancing their professional capabilities by providing thoughtful, honest performance assessments and placing a priority on development. As the CEO, he/she is responsible for developing one or more key leaders from within CCHS to become a viable successor to the CEO role.
The CEO is responsible for ensuring the organization's guiding principles are exhibited through his/her actions, the actions of the leadership team and actions of others throughout organization.

Qualifications
Master's degree in business or health care administration.
Prior experience in a senior leadership role in a primary care organization. Probably 10-15 years of total career experience.
Previous experience as a healthcare service provider where direct patient contact was involved would be a plus.
Experience working in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) would also be a plus.

If this describes you, then we want you on our team! This position requires 30 to 35 hours a week!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent—by delivering an outstanding client experience—so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals. And to never take their patronage for granted.

If you are credentialed, we know you’ve worked hard for your credentialing and we want you to use the knowledge that you’ve invested your time and talent in. The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

As a member of the VCA family, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth.

Dental Implants Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons, in close collaboration with restorative dentists, help plan and then place implants used to replace missing teeth. They can also reconstruct bone in places needing bone for implant placement and modify gingival (gum) tissue surrounding implants when necessary to make teeth placed on implants look even more natural. Facial Trauma Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons care for facial injuries by repairing routine and complex facial skin lacerations (cuts), setting fractured jaw and facial bones, reconnecting severed nerves and ducts, and treating other injuries. These procedures include care of oral tissues, the jaws, cheek and nasal bones, the forehead, and eye sockets. Pathologic Conditions Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons manage patients with benign and malignant cysts and tumors of the oral and facial regions. Severe infections of the oral cavity, salivary glands, jaws, and neck are also treated. Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgery Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons correct jaw, facial bone and facial soft tissue problems left as the result of previous trauma or removal of pathology. This surgery to restore form and function often includes moving skin, bone, nerves, and other tissues from other parts of the body to reconstruct the jaws and face. These same skills are also used when oral and maxillofacial surgeons perform cosmetic procedures for improvement of problems due to unwanted facial features or aging. Facial Pain Including Temporomandibular Joint Disorders Maxillofacial Surgeons possess skills in the diagnosis and treatment of facial pain disorders including those due to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems.

VCA Valley Animal Hospital is an AAHA -accredited practice that also services exotic pets and working dogs. Our state-of-the-art facility features surgical suites, a comprehensive pharmacy, advanced in-house and reference laboratories, ultrasound, digital and dental radiology, and transfusion therapies. Our professional team consists of 12 doctors and 60+ support staff members who pride themselves on providing the utmost care for both critically ill patients as well as those in need of routine wellness care.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right. If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether.

Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

They also provide sophisticated, safe, and effective anesthesia services in their office including intravenous (IV) sedation and general anesthesia. Dental Implants Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons, in close collaboration with restorative dentists, help plan and then place implants used to replace missing teeth. They can also reconstruct bone in places needing bone for implant placement and modify gingival (gum) tissue surrounding implants when necessary to make teeth placed on implants look even more natural. Facial Trauma Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons care for facial injuries by repairing routine and complex facial skin lacerations (cuts), setting fractured jaw and facial bones, reconnecting severed nerves and ducts, and treating other injuries. These procedures include care of oral tissues, the jaws, cheek and nasal bones, the forehead, and eye sockets. Pathologic Conditions Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons manage patients with benign and malignant cysts and tumors of the oral and facial regions. Severe infections of the oral cavity, salivary glands, jaws, and neck are also treated. Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgery Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons correct jaw, facial bone and facial soft tissue problems left as the result of previous trauma or removal of pathology. This surgery to restore form and function often includes moving skin, bone, nerves, and other tissues from other parts of the body to reconstruct the jaws and face. These same skills are also used when oral and maxillofacial surgeons perform cosmetic procedures for improvement of problems due to unwanted facial features or aging. Facial Pain Including Temporomandibular Joint Disorders Maxillofacial Surgeons possess skills in the diagnosis and treatment of facial pain disorders including those due to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems.

Each office is a general dentistry office with a focus on dentures via an in-house laboratory. We ask the Managers to take a great amount of responsibility and with that comes authority over many areas. With that also comes the chance for great rewards - financial and otherwise.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right. If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent, in every interaction, so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals—and to never take their patronage for granted.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right. If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent, in every interaction, so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals—and to never take their patronage for granted.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right. If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent, in every interaction, so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals—and to never take their patronage for granted.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

At VCA, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We offer competitive compensation ($12.00 to start; max depending on experience) and a comprehensive benefits package, including, medical/dental/vision coverage and paid vacation (for F/T employees only), 401(k), uniform allowance, generous personal pet care discounts, and more.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right. If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right.

If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent, in every interaction, so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals—and to never take their patronage for granted.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

At VCA, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We offer competitive compensation and a comprehensive benefits package, including medical/dental/vision coverage and paid vacation (for F/T employees only), 401(k), uniform allowance, generous personal pet care discounts, and more.

We offer opportunities for dentists to demonstrate their skill and abilities at all levels, as well as participate in rewards based on the success of the practice.


We offer our dentists the flexibility to choose the scope of dentistry they want to practice, then expand their knowledge and experience through our Dentist Career Path program. The program provides potential career growth and advancement to higher levels of responsibility, supervision and compensation.


We believe that being a DCA-affiliated dentist gives dentists the opportunity to focus on patient care, enjoy their careers and live their lives on their own terms. Although we realize many dentists envision a time when they have ownership in their own dental offices, independent sources confirm it would take at least 15 years of ownership to match or exceed the compensation outlined in the DCA program.


It is our intent to help our affiliated dentists achieve the benefits of ownership without the risks, capital costs and retirement concerns of actual ownership. We do, however, provide the opportunity for selected dentists to build equity and explore opportunities to buy into existing DCA practices or partner with DCA to open new practices as part of our DCA Dentist Equity program.


Currently we have an outstanding opportunity for an experienced General Dentist to practice in one of our highly successful affiliated practice in Palm Coast, Florida. State of the art practice facilities. Strong commitment to long-term dental care for the whole family.

We offer opportunities for dentists to demonstrate their skill and abilities at all levels, as well as participate in rewards based on the success of the practice.


We offer our dentists the flexibility to choose the scope of dentistry they want to practice, then expand their knowledge and experience through our Dentist Career Path program. The program provides potential career growth and advancement to higher levels of responsibility, supervision and compensation.


We believe that being a DCA-affiliated dentist gives dentists the opportunity to focus on patient care, enjoy their careers and live their lives on their own terms. Although we realize many dentists envision a time when they have ownership in their own dental offices, independent sources confirm it would take at least 15 years of ownership to match or exceed the compensation outlined in the DCA program.


It is our intent to help our affiliated dentists achieve the benefits of ownership without the risks, capital costs and retirement concerns of actual ownership. We do, however, provide the opportunity for selected dentists to build equity and explore opportunities to buy into existing DCA practices or partner with DCA to open new practices as part of our DCA Dentist Equity program.


Currently we have an outstanding opportunity for an experienced General Dentist to practice in one of our highly successful affiliated practices. State of the art practice facilities. Strong commitment to long-term dental care for the whole family.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right. If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent—by delivering an outstanding client experience—so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals. And to never take their patronage for granted.

You’ve worked hard for your credentialing and we want you to use the knowledge that you’ve invested your time and talent in. The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

At VCA, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We offer competitive compensation and a comprehensive benefits package, including, medical/dental/vision coverage and paid vacation (for F/T employees only), 401(k), uniform allowance, generous personal pet care discounts, and more.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right.

If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent—by delivering an outstanding client experience—so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals. And to never take their patronage for granted.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

As a member of the VCA family, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We offer competitive compensation along with a comprehensive benefits package, including, medical/dental/vision and paid vacation (for F/T employees only), 401(k), generous personal pet care discounts and more!

Our professional team consists of 12 doctors and 60+ support staff members who pride themselves on providing the utmost care for both critically ill patients as well as those in need of routine wellness care.

If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether.

Requirements

State of Nebraska Veterinary Technician License required.

Please note that this position requires the ability to work evenings, overnights, weekends, and holidays.

Why We Need You

Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent—by delivering an outstanding client experience—so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals. And to never take their patronage for granted.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

At VCA, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We offer competitive compensation!

Please note that this position requires a flexible schedule and the ability to work days, evenings, overnights, weekends, and holidays. This position also requires an on-call rotation.

If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right.

If this describes you, then we want you on our team! Exotics experience a big plus!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent—by delivering an outstanding client experience—so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals. And to never take their patronage for granted.

If you are credentialed, we know that you’ve worked hard for your credentialing and we want you to use the knowledge that you’ve invested your time and talent in. The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

As a member of the VCA family, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We offer competitive compensation along with a comprehensive benefits package, including, medical/dental/vision and paid vacation (for F/T employees only), 401(k), generous personal pet care discounts and more!

DIRECTOR OF THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM


Marquette University, a private, coeducational, Catholic, Jesuit institution in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is seeking to hire a visionary director of its Educational Opportunity Program ( EOP ). Founded in 1969, EOP is an academic program that motivates and enables low-income and first generation students, whose parents do not have a baccalaureate degree, to enter and succeed in higher education. Marquette’s EOP is a national flagship TRIO program—one of the oldest and largest of its kind in the country—and plays a key role in fulfilling the University’s mission. EOP consists of the following five federally funded TRIO projects with an annual federal budget of almost $1.4 million and university budget of over $2.5 million (including $2.2 million financial aid for EOP students).


The director oversees a staff of 23 employees, serving approximately 300 Marquette undergraduates and 200 high school students primarily from the greater Milwaukee area. The director works closely with the seven undergraduate colleges and several academic units to ensure the recruitment and retention of the program’s students. The director also collaborates with community partners to create pathways to higher education for students across Milwaukee and beyond. The director reports to the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.


The successful candidate will work collaboratively with the colleges, senior administration, faculty, and staff; be self-directed, exercise initiative, balance multiple priorities, adapt effectively to change, thrive in a fast-paced environment; have demonstrated knowledge of student support pedagogy and possess a demonstrated record of effective use of technology and institutional research; experience serving low-income students; a record of leadership and management in a college or university, and a demonstrated ability to interact effectively with individuals of diverse cultural, ethnic, economic, and educational backgrounds.


Core EOP projects:


Upward Bound (UB) and Upward Bound Math & Science UBMS .

UB and UBMS are federally funded TRIO programs. Our mission is to assist and educate low-income and first-generation high school freshmeeen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors in their goal of becoming a college graduate. The UBMS program is for students with a strong interest in the math, science, or technology field. We recruit students who live in the city of Milwaukee.

It offers a network of supportive services, financial aid assistance, a pre-enrollment summer program, academic counseling, specialized courses, seminars and tutoring, as well as personal, educational, graduate and career counseling.

Learn more about Student Support Services


Ronald E. McNair Scholars

McNair Scholars prepares eligible students for graduate school. During the academic year, students attend monthly seminars, meet visiting scholars, and participate in student and professional conferences. The McNair director is available to provide specialized academic advising, admissions and financial aid application assistance. During the summer, McNair students may apply to participate in SOAR , a paid research internship which provides an in-depth research experience, working one-on-one with a faculty mentor, and the opportunity to network nationally.

Learn more about McNair Scholars


Talent Search

Marquette University was awarded a federal grant for Talent Search in September 2016, and it is thus the newest core project for EOP . The Department of Education describes the goal of Talent Search as: “to increase the number of youth from disadvantaged backgrounds who complete high school and enroll in and complete their postsecondary education.” The program provides academic, career, and financial counseling to its participants and encourages them to graduate from high school and continue on to and complete their postsecondary education.


Key opportunities and challenges


Providing visionary leadership for increasing access and opportunity to higher education in the 21st century

The director will work with EOP and other University leaders to address the challenges facing underrepresented populations in the 21st century. The director will help develop initiatives to overcome barriers to access and opportunity, and communicate how such initiatives promote an overarching University vision. Among other priorities, Marquette University has announced its commitment to becoming a Hispanic Serving Institution in the next decade, and the director of EOP will work with the Executive Director of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and others to fulfill this commitment.


Serving students by providing opportunities for learning for people who might not otherwise have access to higher education

The director will lead EOP to fulfill the University’s commitment to creating access and opportunity for underrepresented populations in line with Marquette University’s ambitious strategic plan, Beyond Boundaries. More information on the strategic plan can be found on the strategic planning website: http://www.marquette.edu/strategic-planning/. The strategic plan has specific goals for increasing diversity of the student population and raising retention and six-year graduation rates. The director of EOP will work with units across campus to help meet these goals, particularly for students from underrepresented populations.


Enhancing grant writing infrastructure

EOP depends for the majority of its budget on five federal grants from the Department of Education. While the program has enjoyed tremendous success in securing and retaining grant funding, the next director will engage all EOP staff in building more formalized processes for developing, vetting, and submitting grant applications. The next director may also explore other funding opportunities, such as through the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, etc.


Managing new project opportunities while promoting a positive workplace climate

With the recent addition of the Talent Search grant, the director will work with EOP staff to manage this and other new exciting opportunities while continuing to promote a positive workplace climate for all employees and students, and formalize policies, procedures, and professional development opportunities.


Increasing the profile of EOP on campus and across Milwaukee

Internal academic program review and external reviewers both indicated opportunities for EOP to increase its profile as an institution central to Marquette University’s mission. On campus, the director will have opportunities to develop more collaborative partnerships with other academic and co-curricular units. In Greater Milwaukee, the director will have opportunities to enhance existing partnerships with public and private high schools, as well as other community groups and nonprofits engaged in creating access to high-quality education for all.

As an institution committed to both teaching and research, Marquette offers undergraduate programs in 161 majors and minors, in addition to more than 60 master’s and doctoral programs. Marquette is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, which reaffirmed the university’s accreditation in 2014.


Marquette ranks 86th in the U.S. News & World Report 2016 edition of America’s Best Colleges. Among its peers, Marquette is distinguished for its emphasis on connecting academic excellence and service to others, which is intrinsic to a Catholic, Jesuit education. In Marquette’s 2015 senior survey, 82 percent of seniors said they participated in community service. Marquette’s commitment to connecting academic achievement and service to others has been recognized nationally in a variety of venues. In other rankings, The Princeton Review named Marquette one of the country’s “Best 379 Colleges” and included the university on the “2015 Guide to Green Colleges,” elected for being environmentally aware and sustainable, specifically for students’ campus quality of life that is healthy and sustainable, and for preparing students for employment in the clean energy economy of the 21st century. Marquette also prides itself on maintaining a student retention rate about ten percentage points higher than the national average for private, non-profit colleges and universities, with approximately 90 percent of students returning for their sophomore year. Marquette has a proud intercollegiate athletic tradition as a NCAA -Division I institution and competes in the Big East Conference.


Marquette University’s strategic plan, Beyond Boundaries, includes the following goal themes, which aim to propel the university forward in innovative and collaborative ways:


• Advance Marquette as a highly ranked destination university, renowned for academic rigor, high impact educational experiences, innovation in teaching and learning, and achievements of its community of scholars;

• Advance Marquette as a university committed to research and scholarship, with a distinctive emphasis on excellence in strategically-defined areas including innovation;

• Foster a diverse teaching and learning environment in a culture that values, respects, welcomes, and promotes a sense of belonging for members of our campus and our community;

• Distinguished by our ethics, service and promotion of justice, position Marquette as a pivotal partner and resource to address issues within our community and beyond its boundaries;

• Define the Marquette experience as personally transformative, grounded in Jesuit spirituality and pedagogy, informed by/in dialogue with the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic social teaching, and formative in developing men and women of faith and service for and with others;

• Continuously improve university operations to increase efficiencies, sustain shared resources, and thrive in tomorrow’s higher education landscape.


Coordinate development, external funding, and implementation of a comprehensive support program for educationally and economically disadvantaged Marquette undergraduates and potential Marquette students, in order to motivate and prepare them for success in baccalaureate and postbaccalaureate programs; strengthen Marquette’s capacity to attract and retain such students as an integral part of the Marquette community.

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right. If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent—by delivering an outstanding client experience—so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals. And to never take their patronage for granted.

You’ve worked hard for your credentialing and we want you to use the knowledge that you’ve invested your time and talent in. The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

As a member of the VCA family, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We have spent over 40 years advocating for and creating a health-home for the many that have been denied access to care. As health care activists, we are dedicated to ensuring that individuals who do not have healthcare coverage receive the same quality healthcare as those who do. From our genesis as a community health center in 1971, we understood that we cannot heal our communities without also addressing the economic and social factors that affect health. Many times, this requires that we go outside and provide services in other settings that link individuals to our health center for preventive and primary care. Over 90,000 individuals come to La Clínica because it is a welcoming place that addresses the whole person, coordinating and connecting them to a broad network of services to improve and maintain their health and well-being. While we are still known for our activism and spirit of social justice, we are also proud to have grown into a sophisticated provider of primary health care services with 35 sites across Alameda, Contra Costa and Solano counties.

Be part of an excellent care team: We are looking for Dental Assistants who want to serve as a valuable member of our care team by work alongside dentists in fourhanded dentistry. In our dental practice, you will be relied on for your superb technical skills to improve the quality and efficiency of our clinic while at the same time providing a human touch to the overall patient experience. Many people excel at one of these areas, but it takes someone with a special combination of skills and character to do both. To be successful, you need to enjoy interacting with all kinds of different people, to feel energized by a fast paced clinic environment, and remain cool under pressure even when serving a person who is upset, disrespectful or impatient. You should have a successful history of being responsible, reliable and capable of solving problems while being friendly and helpful in looking for ways to support other care team members.

Major Areas of Responsibility include but are not limited to:

We’re looking for a believer in the possibilities of high-quality veterinary medicine and patient care—with the experience and technical know-how to make them happen….a devoted team player who thrives in a collaborative environment, and is invested in their colleagues’ success….someone who takes enormous pride in their ability to listen and speak to clients like a trusted friend….a service-minded professional who is energized by the gratitude of others and in the satisfaction of a job done right.

If this describes you, then we want you on our team!

Why We Need You

We recognize that our clients have many choices in veterinary care, including the choice to skip it altogether. Your mission will be to win the confidence of every pet parent, in every interaction, so they will partner with us for the lifelong care of their companion animals—and to never take their patronage for granted.

The skills that you will be utilizing include, but are not limited to: venipuncture, catheter placement, radiology, anesthesia monitoring, physical examinations and patient assessment, surgical preparation and assisting, dentistry, laboratory work, pharmacy, patient recovery, and compassionate care for our hospitalized patients.

Your teaching and marketing skills will also come into play, as you educate clients on the value of advanced veterinary care. You will be in a unique position to coach them on keeping their pets healthy, as well as validating any concerns they may have in collaborating with the doctor. Making a positive impact on both the patient’s life and the client’s is a privilege that you will share in.

Perhaps the greatest asset you will bring is your emotional intelligence. As you know, the hospitalization of a beloved pet can be a stressful situation for everyone involved. At times, your ability to maintain a cool head and treat clients according to the Golden Rule will be tested. But we have faith in your professionalism and know that you won’t let us, your patients—or yourself—down!

Why You Should Consider Us

As a member of the VCA family, your passion for medicine and compassion for pets and people is matched with a commitment to your professional growth. You will enjoy exposure to a diverse and stimulating caseload, employ the most advanced imaging and monitoring tools, and tap into the expertise of more than 3,000 doctors, including 360+ boarded specialists. You will sharpen your skills—and even learn some new techniques—and explore career options that only VCA can offer, such as continuing education, transfer, specialization, and leadership opportunities.

We offer competitive compensation along with a comprehensive benefits package, including, medical/dental/vision and paid vacation (for F/T employees only), 401(k), generous personal pet care discounts and more!

Please note that this position requires a flexible schedule and the ability to work some weekends and some holidays.
