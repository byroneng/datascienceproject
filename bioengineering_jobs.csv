Biochemical and biophysical changes in chromatin have been implicated in developmental progression and biomedically relevant processes such as stem cell differentiation and cellular reprogramming. However, our ability to control and perturb the many properties of chromatin is lacking. A synthetic biology approach is proposed to develop molecular tools that can edit chromatin chemistry and structure in a highly controlled manner.


The purpose of this Research Scholar position is to develop new molecular tools that can control the biochemistry and biophysics of chromatin in mammalian and yeast cells. This will entail high throughput molecular biology, biochemistry, cell culture, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and systems biology analysis. The initial goals will be to demonstrate the ability to alter chromatin states at individual endogenous loci. These tools will then be applied to controlling and enhancing the transitions between different biomedically relevant cell states. This includes stem cell differentiation and reprogramming to cells for use in cell replacement therapies.

By implementing a team science approach on a large scale we strive to generate useful public resources, drive technological innovations and discover fundamental brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory.

POSITION SUMMARY

Electric stimulation has long been employed to perturb physiological and pathological processing in humans and animals. In the human brain, invasive electric stimulation approaches have been used e.g. in Parkinson’s disease to prevent motor symptoms and in epilepsy to prevent or disrupt seizures. Concurrently, ongoing efforts are testing electric stimulation as a means to treat neurological and psychiatric conditions such as depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite its rich history, extensive usage and exciting potential, the functionality and behavioral consequences of electric intervention in the mammalian brain are poorly understood. The behavioral and cognitive effects induced by electric stimulation are difficult to predict and its long-term effects ill-known. As a consequence, electric stimulation treatment remains phenomenological and in many cases, despite its promise, ineffective.

We are seeking to fill a position at the level of Scientist to work on an exciting new translational neuroscience pilot project at the Institute to (1) understand the local and distributed brain circuits excited or suppressed during stimulus injection, and (2) develop optimized methodologies and stimulation protocols for the entrainment of cortical and associated brain areas. The Scientist to be hired will pursue an experimental component of a joint experimental and theory/modeling collaborative project.

RESPONSIBILITIES

Carry out experimental studies of brain stimulation in combination with high density electrical probe recordings in the mouse cortex

Design, implement and analyze large-scale neural recordings with brain stimulation

Quantitative analysis of stimulation effects on LFP and spiking activity in the cortical circuit

Publish/present findings in peer-reviewed journals/scientific conferences.

Our people are the most important asset in our pursuit of achieving excellence in education, research, and community service. Our staff not only enjoys outstanding benefits and professional growth opportunities, but also an environment noted for diversity, community involvement, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits, and natural beauty.


The Department of Biochemistry at the University of Washington has contributed to many phases of research. Initially recognized for incisive studies of the structure and function of proteins, and the mechanisms of enzyme action, the department branched out into a multitude of other areas. These included: developmental biology of flies, fish, frogs, and mice; molecular mechanisms of aging in yeast and mammals; vertebrate visual and immune responses; chromosome dynamics, cell division, DNA replication and repair; energy transduction during photosynthesis; protein secretion and membrane fusion; translational control and regulated protein degradation; protein structure determination by crystallography and NMR spectroscopy; and protein structure prediction and enzyme design. Our diversity of interests guarantees a rich intellectual and educational environment.


The Department of Biochemistry and the Institute for Protein Design (IPD) at the University of Washington School of Medicine currently has an outstanding opportunity for a Research Scientist/Engineer 2 position in de novo engineering of small molecule protein binders. The position is open immediately. The Gu laboratory is developing novel technologies to engineer ligand-responsive protein assemblies; in particular, we develop and use high-throughput binder selection approaches to engineer chemically induced dimerization systems as small molecule sensors. We focus on protein interaction sequencing technologies by coupling ‘protein barcoding’ techniques to in situ barcode (or polony) sequencing, a powerful extension of next-generation DNA sequencing. In situ polony sequencing can directly measure protein interactions in massively parallel at a single-molecule or single-cell level. An example of protein interaction sequencing is a single-molecular-interaction sequencing (SMI-seq) technology we recently developed (Nature, 2014, 515:554–557) for ‘library-by-library’ or ‘all-by-all’ interaction profiling. We apply SMI-seq and others to quantitative profiling and engineering of protein interactions.


The Research Scientist/Engineer in the lab will use synthetic binder libraries and protein display techniques to select small molecule binders. He or she can understand, use and improve modern protein engineering technologies. He or she can assist the develop of next-generation protein binder selection techniques, the validation of binder functions, and the demonstration of binder applications in vitro and in vivo.


Responsibilities of this position include but are not limited to:


Construction of protein binder libraries.

Our people are the most important asset in our pursuit of achieving excellence in education, research, and community service. Our staff not only enjoys outstanding benefits and professional growth opportunities, but also an environment noted for diversity, community involvement, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits, and natural beauty.


The Department of Biochemistry at the University of Washington has contributed to many phases of research. Initially recognized for incisive studies of the structure and function of proteins, and the mechanisms of enzyme action, the department branched out into a multitude of other areas. These included: developmental biology of flies, fish, frogs, and mice; molecular mechanisms of aging in yeast and mammals; vertebrate visual and immune responses; chromosome dynamics, cell division, DNA replication and repair; energy transduction during photosynthesis; protein secretion and membrane fusion; translational control and regulated protein degradation; protein structure determination by crystallography and NMR spectroscopy; and protein structure prediction and enzyme design. Our diversity of interests guarantees a rich intellectual and educational environment.


The Department of Biochemistry and the Institute for Protein Design (IPD) at the University of Washington School of Medicine currently has an outstanding opportunity for a Research Scientist/Engineer 2 position in de novo engineering of small molecule protein binders. The position is open immediately. The Gu laboratory is developing novel technologies to engineer ligand-responsive protein assemblies; in particular, we develop and use high-throughput binder selection approaches to engineer chemically induced dimerization systems as small molecule sensors. We focus on protein interaction sequencing technologies by coupling ‘protein barcoding’ techniques to in situ barcode (or polony) sequencing, a powerful extension of next-generation DNA sequencing. In situ polony sequencing can directly measure protein interactions in massively parallel at a single-molecule or single-cell level. An example of protein interaction sequencing is a single-molecular-interaction sequencing (SMI-seq) technology we recently developed (Nature, 2014, 515:554–557) for ‘library-by-library’ or ‘all-by-all’ interaction profiling. We apply SMI-seq and others to quantitative profiling and engineering of protein interactions.


The Research Scientist/Engineer in the lab will use synthetic binder libraries and protein display techniques to select small molecule binders. He or she can understand, use and improve modern protein engineering technologies. He or she can assist the develop of next-generation protein binder selection techniques, the validation of binder functions, and the demonstration of binder applications in vitro and in vivo.


Responsibilities of this position include but are not limited to:


Construction of protein binder libraries.

Phage display selection of protein binder libraries.

Validation and characterization of protein binders.

Develop applications of protein binders.

Protein structure determination.

Tissue culture.
