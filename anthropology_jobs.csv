of Program:
The
University of Colorado Boulder is home to a dozen or so Residential Academic
Programs, or “RAPs.” RAPs provide enhanced academic and social environments
to help students succeed in the critical first year of college (and beyond).

Sewall RAP—UC
Boulder’s first RAP—is housed in beautiful Sewall Hall, UC Boulder’s first
residence hall. The academic focus of
Sewall RAP is on social sciences, history, culture, and education. In particular, Sewall RAP aims to attract and
serve students who are considering teaching careers.

Overview of

Job Duties:

are seeking outstanding candidates to teach courses
in two or more of the Sewall RAP focus
areas described above. Class size is generally 17-20 students, and active
learning and student engagement are important components of RAP
classes. The overall teaching load is three courses a semester, some of
which may be taught with Sewall RAP partnering units, such
as other RAP programs, depending on need. The successful
applicant will have demonstrated superior teaching
of undergraduate courses in small
sections. Experience teaching in a residence hall, and experience
working with pre-service teachers, are helpful but not required. Service is
an important aspect of the position, and will include planning and attending
co-curricular events associated with classes, as well other activities
intended to help build community within the residence hall. This position
will be filled at the instructor level.

One of CARE’s flagship gender-transformative programs is the “Pathways to Empowerment” program, a $15,000,000, 60-month grant with the overall goal of increasing poor women smallholder farmers’ productivity and empowerment in more equitable agriculture systems at scale. It is being implemented in six diverse countries – Malawi, Tanzania, Mali, Ghana, India, and Bangladesh. The program builds on and is inspired by the vital roles that women play around the world in smallholder agriculture, meeting the food and nutrition needs of their household and contributing to economic development. This integrated program combines the themes of women’s empowerment, systems change, value chain development, and sustainable agriculture, with a strong research and learning component. The program follows three mutually enforcing objectives:


Increase the productivity and empowerment of 150,000 poor women farmers in sustainable and equitable agricultural systems
Enhance the scale of high-quality, women- responsive agriculture programming
Influence debates and policy dialogue on women and agriculture at local, national and global levels
Pathways activity programming follows CARE’s women’s empowerment framework, which looks for interventions to strengthen women’s agency; create gender-equitable structures (including norms); and improve equity in relationships. Working with men and boys is a critical lever of change, and it represents a relatively new area of programming for CARE and in development in general.
