Leave the software engineering work behind as you head out on the water for an evening of fishing, appease your eclectic interests with cultural events, enjoy the comfort and familiarity of a small town, and do it all while advancing your technical career.


Although you realize there is more to life than work, you're not willing to compromise on your commitment to learning, improving, and excelling as a professional software engineer. See if some of these things ring true with you:

You've been doing software development in some of the core technologies in use today including Java, C#, ASP.NET, MVC, and JavaScript
You can map business requirements to a database design and walk your stakeholders through the stickier parts of the business process, but you also work with other developers to address database performance and security concerns
You have software programming hobby projects that dive into JavaScript frameworks like Bootstrap and Node.js; you're eager to do more
You understand and believe that people are the most important part of the software development process, not just tools, technologies, and procedures
User interface design may not be your gift, but you've realized that users expect more; you've taken steps to improve the user experience of your applications
Now you're wondering, ""What's next?"" and ""Where do I want to take my career?"" Consider that after a year at RDI, you would be:

Working directly with clients in a consulting role, helping them understand how new software will change their business processes and what needs to be done for smooth implementations
Working with a wide support group of peers, both locally and across other offices, who are available for support and assistance, and always willing to help
Influencing technology, process, and design choices; you'll be able to point to significant decisions that were made and see the results you've affected
Living a full life--one that is personally and professionally rewarding--and looking forward to what the next 1, 5, and 10 years with RDI look like
The RDI Juneau office is located in one of the most beautiful places on earth. We have a strong commitment to the local community and are looking for people to help us continue building on our strong reputation. You likely have a background in enterprise web application development and 5-10 years of experience in software development, but we're more interested in what you've accomplished. Opportunities at RDI are endless for the achievement-oriented professional.


If you'd like to be considered for this position, send us your resume and a quick summary of two significant accomplishments. One of them should be related to a team project and the other an individual accomplishment highlighting your role as a consultant. Each description should be a paragraph or two long; the more descriptive (fewer bullets), the better. Check out www.resdat.com and contact us to learn more about why we offer great career opportunities.

There's a tight loop between development, feedback and deployment, and that's why we're so good at building world-class solutions to our unique business, marketing and data quandaries. You'll share your expertise through your close communication, hands-on leadership and talented coding.
We value growth and curiosity. Want to learn a new language? Go for it!

Description


Every day, the people of TSYS® improve lives and businesses around the globe through payments. We make it possible for millions of people to move money between buyers and sellers using our payments solutions including credit, debit, prepaid and merchant services. We are ""People-Centered Payments"", and our team has the unique opportunity to help create a world in which payments make people's lives easier and better. This is both a tremendous honor and an important responsibility for those who accept the challenge. If you are looking to make a valuable difference for people everywhere — and for yourself — TSYS may be the right place for you.


Who we are…


TSYS is a leading financial services provider, and the technology behind many successful financial brands, products and programs. We have a people-centered focus - with our customers and within our team. That focus has helped us to innovate and grow our business to where it is today. It’s also helped us build a close-knit team that enjoys new ideas and solving problems together.


You might fit well in the product innovation team if you enjoy technology, are passionate about the things you create, enjoy setting your own direction and moving fast. This includes sharing opinions within the team, taking initiative to learn new things and putting in the work to make our products the best.


As a Product Engineer …


You are responsible for delivering an end-to-end solution from initial concept through finished solution. You’ll need the ability to quickly understand needs, from a user perspective, and move from there to a working prototype that captures the essence of what the product should be. The ability to not only code, but also assemble and integrate technology across disparate platforms is critical to success. This includes a deep understanding of systems, data structures, modern scripting and enterprise level languages as well as open source tools that can and should be leveraged to solve problems. You’ll work in a rapid environment where there aren’t always clear specifications or rules about how something should be done, where its up to you to figure things out and keep things moving. Some other things you’ll do regularly include:


- Write lots of code in an environment that leverages open technology such as javascript, python, java, kafka, docker, storm, MongoDB, zookeeper, reactJS, swift and plenty of others

- Analyze business requirements and develop prototypes through working solutions

- Integrate systems using a wide variety of protocols like REST, SOAP, MQ, TCP/IP, JSON and a number of others

- Create automated tests that easily plug into our automated code pipeline

- Attend sessions where we eat pizza and talk about the latest technology

- Help mentor other engineers and technical analysts

- Plan sprints within your project team to keep yourself and the team moving forward

- Move fast, break things, and determine how to fix them


Who you are…


You’re someone who wants to influence your own development. You’re not intimidated by technology, you know how to leverage it to build great products. Your skills are broad –user experience, integration, database, even business domains – and you easily transition between those. You like to leverage modern technology and can quickly assemble it to create solutions that aren’t over-engineered. You’re also comfortable in a role where a job title is not considered the final definition of who you are, but just a starting point.

Last but not least, you will, of course, need to know Java. We are looking for people with demonstrated capabilities with Java. The more experience you have with technologies like J2EE, EJB, Groovy/Grails, Spring and AJAX the better.
Why Centric?
Supportive environment – Our clients expect a lot from our developers. But you won’t be asked to do it alone. You will have the full support of the Columbus office leadership and everyone at Centric. We love to help people succeed.
Growth opportunities – As a mid-size firm, we can be more flexible when it comes to career paths. Figure out what you want to do, and we’ll figure out how to get you there.
Unique culture – Hands down, the people are the best part of Centric. But don’t take our word on it – check us out on Facebook or Twitter to get a glimpse inside the fun.
Network of technology champions – There’s no fun in being the only geek in the room. We celebrate all things tech. For example, we hold a yearly gathering called Camp I/O. In the spirit of TEDx talks, Camp I/O is an opportunity for technology-minded people across Centric to get together and show off what they can do when not constrained by client requirements and platforms. Check out some of the innovative presentations from Camp I/O 2014 .
Low travel – It’s time to get off the road. We want you focused on Cincinnati. Expect less than 5% travel. That said, if you like being a road warrior just let us know. As with all things at Centric, we are flexible."

Description


Every day, the people of TSYS® improve lives and businesses around the globe through payments. We make it possible for millions of people to move money between buyers and sellers using our payments solutions including credit, debit, prepaid and merchant services. We are ""People-Centered Payments"", and our team has the unique opportunity to help create a world in which payments make people's lives easier and better. This is both a tremendous honor and an important responsibility for those who accept the challenge. If you are looking to make a valuable difference for people everywhere — and for yourself — TSYS may be the right place for you.


Who we are…


TSYS is a leading financial services provider, and the technology behind many successful financial brands, products and programs. We have a people-centered focus - with our customers and within our team. That focus has helped us to innovate and grow our business to where it is today. It’s also helped us build a close-knit team that enjoys new ideas and solving problems together.


You might fit well in the product innovation team if you enjoy technology, are passionate about the things you create, enjoy setting your own direction and moving fast. This includes sharing opinions within the team, taking initiative to learn new things and putting in the work to make our products the best.


As a Product Engineer …


You are responsible for delivering an end-to-end solution from initial concept through finished solution. You’ll need the ability to quickly understand needs, from a user perspective, and move from there to a working prototype that captures the essence of what the product should be. The ability to not only code, but also assemble and integrate technology across disparate platforms is critical to success. This includes a deep understanding of systems, data structures, modern scripting and enterprise level languages as well as open source tools that can and should be leveraged to solve problems. You’ll work in a rapid environment where there aren’t always clear specifications or rules about how something should be done, where its up to you to figure things out and keep things moving. Some other things you’ll do regularly include:


- Write lots of code in an environment that leverages open technology such as javascript, python, java, kafka, docker, storm, MongoDB, zookeeper, reactJS, swift and plenty of others

- Analyze business requirements and develop prototypes through working solutions

- Integrate systems using a wide variety of protocols like REST, SOAP, MQ, TCP/IP, JSON and a number of others

- Create automated tests that easily plug into our automated code pipeline

- Attend sessions where we eat pizza and talk about the latest technology

- Help mentor other engineers and technical analysts

- Plan sprints within your project team to keep yourself and the team moving forward

- Move fast, break things, and determine how to fix them


Who you are…


You’re someone who wants to influence your own development. You’re not intimidated by technology, you know how to leverage it to build great products. Your skills are broad –user experience, integration, database, even business domains – and you easily transition between those. You like to leverage modern technology and can quickly assemble it to create solutions that aren’t over-engineered. You’re also comfortable in a role where a job title is not considered the final definition of who you are, but just a starting point.

SpatialKey is a Software as a Service (SaaS) mapping and data visualization platform. We create applications that let enterprise customers take large amounts of data they might have about their businesses and turn it into information they can use. Currently we are focused on the insurance industry and creating apps giving these customers the ability to know how many buildings they have in the path of an oncoming hurricane, or what the flood risk is at a given location, or how much damage the worst theoretical tornado strike can do to their portfolio, etc.

We’re a 100% remote company of about 35 people, with about half of that being dev. You’ll be part of an agile server software team that brings our product to life by implementing services and application programming interfaces using a wide range of Open Source technologies that our incredible front end developers utilize to create amazing user experiences. If you have a desire to develop and ship complex enterprise applications in a team environment, let’s chat.

The following are some of the primary responsibilities:

Write, maintain and debug production level server Java code
Learn new technologies and think about how they may or may not fit
Collaborate closely with QA, PM, UX, and other Software Engineers
Understand and improve upon current build/deployment practices
Identify opportunities for improvements and optimizations
Advocate for the performance and integrity of solutions
Troubleshoot customer support issues

Why work with us?

We are committed to building a high growth business alongside very supportive clients, who are also pursuing competitive edge and innovation. We have been in business since 2011; and have strong brand recognition and equity, a profit-positive balance sheet, an exciting growth story, and a proven vision. We are committed to an autonomous and remote work environment with headquarters in Denver, but with our entire team working remotely across the globe. We are growing deliberately by carefully hiring the best people in the industry.

About Us

SpatialKey is reinventing the way insurers transform data into actionable intelligence. SpatialKey solutions amplify the value of insured data and expert content through unmatched user experiences and breakthrough geospatial business intelligence. Through focused analytics and agile visualizations, SpatialKey helps more than 100 insurers understand global risk accumulations and composition, respond to live catastrophe events, and manage exposure proactively at the point of underwriting.

About the job

There is a lot to learn and a lot of opportunity to grow with SpatialKey as the company grows. We are looking for someone with a solid base of programming knowledge, a love of open source software and a continuous drive to learn something new daily. Don’t worry if you are not familiar with some of our core areas we will mentor and assist but be ready for the challenge. Here are some of the potential areas where you may spend your time:


SpatialKey Server: Using Java, Hibernate and Spring to build out REST-based services for the SpatialKey front end.
Geocoding integration: Working with industry leading geocoding solutions (we have worked with MapQuest, TomTom, Google, Geocommons) and integrating them into SpatialKey.
SpatialKey Cloud Analytics: Creating analytical services used to to process large amounts of custom data leveraging the latest parallel processing tools & techniques.
And much more…

We love technology and new stuff excites us. We are constantly pushing the envelope to find new ways to innovate and make our product better.

Our current stack is Linux, Apache, Tomcat, PostgreSQL with PostGIS, MongoDB, GridGain, Jenkins, Maven, Flex, React.js, Flux Pattern, Browserify, Phantom.js, and Leaflet. We may not know everything about each of these, but we’re constantly listening, learning, teaching, and contributing.

About you

Being a distributed team takes great communication skills. You can’t be afraid to raise your hand if you’re stuck on something. We need someone who has the ability to work independently and function with little direction. That doesn’t mean we will leave you on an island. You will be surrounded by strong technical resources willing to help and answer questions but ultimately the work you deliver is your responsibility. You should be able to work autonomously and in a small agile team environment. You also need to be self-motivated and continuously keeping up with new technology to drive innovation within SpatialKey.

The University of Arizona Libraries is seeking a creative, enthusiastic, and dedicated professional with strong proficiencies in Java software development to help us significantly advance our digital preservation efforts. The Software Developer plays a key role in the development and enhancement of our installation of all UA Libraries-related applications, with a particular focus on the development of the digital preservation system. As part of the Software & Web Development Team, the Software Developer collaborates with other technology staff, as well as our local and statewide digital preservation groups, to develop and support current production and development application environments.


We are a large academic library providing a broad range of collections and services while supporting diverse audience segments, including undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, staff, community users, and donors. We strive to build elegant, intuitive products that help users achieve their academic and personal goals. Our digital preservation and access systems are foundational to these efforts, and we have recently purchased Ex Libris Rosetta to consolidate and enhance this foundation.


We value diverse viewpoints and the learning that comes from challenging our assumptions. We have fun with our work, take some risks, and foster a transparent, supportive culture where we celebrate in our successes and learn together from our failures. Though your work will be focused on digital preservation, you’ll be working closely with colleagues who have expertise in systems administration, application delivery, user interface design, user experience design, project management, content strategy, and front end and back end web development. We learn new things every day, and share our knowledge with others to encourage one another’s growth and development. In addition, you will be working extensively with stakeholders outside our department, both in our library and at our partner institutions around the state.


We’re committed to using the best tools and approaches to support the work. Our team doesn’t have extensive experience with Java, so we’ll look to you to help develop best practices and show us how the pieces fit together in that stack.


We value open and frequent communication. Currently we use Redmine for issue tracking and Slack and email for asynchronous communication. We use in-person standups to talk about the work on a day-to-day basis and focused meetings to work on planning and process improvement.


At the University of Arizona, we value our inclusive climate because we know that diversity in experiences and perspectives is vital to advancing innovation, critical thinking, solving complex problems, and creating an inclusive academic community. We translate these values into action by seeking individuals who have experience and expertise working with diverse students, colleagues and constituencies. Because we seek a workforce with a wide range of perspectives and experiences, we encourage diverse candidates to apply, including people of color, women, veterans, and individuals with disabilities. As an Employer of National Service, we also welcome alumni of AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, and other national service programs and others who will help us advance our Inclusive Excellence initiative aimed at creating a university that values student, staff, and faculty engagement in addressing issues of diversity and inclusiveness.

Background
In October 2004, APD became an agency separate from the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF), specifically tasked with serving the needs of Floridians with developmental disabilities. Prior to that time, it existed as the Development Disabilities Program within DCF.
APD supports persons with developmental disabilities in living, learning, and working in their communities. APD is responsible for providing services to persons with developmental disabilities, including the operation of all state institutional programs and the programmatic and operational management of Medicaid home and community based waivers established to provide services to persons with developmental disabilities.
One of the core objectives is to increase our Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) maturity in the Care Management Business Area by improving the needs of the individual member, their treatment plan needs, health outcomes and health status.
APD currently relies heavily on manual processes, along with legacy systems to collect and track data consistently and accurately. As a result, there is very limited capability to collect, track, report, and analyze critical data for detection and prevention of fraud, waste and abuse and for needed oversight of the service system.
APD has initiatives and projects underway to increase program accountability, to provide an automated interface with FMMIS, to ensure federal funding is maintained for services, and most importantly, to assure customer health and safety needs are met.
Intent
The Agency for Persons with Disabilities (“APD”, “Agency”) is seeking a Software as a Service (SaaS)/COTS product configuration and support specialist.

Why are Software Engineers in Seattle important at Airbnb?
----------------------------------------------------------

We recently kicked off a new initiative of distributed engineering teams at Airbnb. There is much more that we want to build and so much that we could improve. We value strong engineers who are agile enough to jump into projects across all areas of the stack: Frontend, Backend, Machine Learning, or Full Stack. Our second remote engineering office will be in Seattle.

Our team is a startup within a startup. We build applications ( http://nerds.airbnb.com/life-of-a-ticket/ ) for thousands of Airbnb employees around the world. We own everything related to operationalizing Airbnb to keep it running as a marketplace.

Inspiration starts from within: the same love and thought that goes into building customer facing product goes into our employee facing product. The team takes on the unique opportunity of interfacing directly with stakeholders around the company to build full stack applications with an array of technologies. In fact, our team codes with some of the newest and most diverse set of technologies within Airbnb from Node.js for real time chat and notifications, to Ruby on Rails for customer resolutions, to React.js for user tickets, to Elastic Search for full text user searching.

Our product feedback loop is immediate which means we can rapidly iterate and deploy. If you enjoy building full stack applications from the ground up, leveraging the newest technologies to delight users, and executing like an entrepreneur, then you’ve found the right place.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
What are examples of work that Software Engineers have done at Airbnb?
----------------------------------------------------------------------


We own the application that hundreds of Customer Experience agents use to triage and solve issues at scale.
Our payments platform transmits billions of dollars in dozens of different currencies among over 100 countries. By integrating new partners, we can both optimize our costs and grow our business by better supporting different countries.
We re-built the List Your Space flow ( http://t.sidekickopen16.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XZsf6xQ4W7gs9sY63BzGnW1p7ZwM56dC6Df2KTHXP02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2Fnew&si;=5056637515071488π=134efae9-f729-4187-b1a2-efb07d53ab22 ). We A/B tested every change carefully and within three months doubled the conversion rate.
We created Neighborhoods ( http://t.sidekickopen16.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XZsf6xQ4W7gs9sY63BzGnW1p7ZwM56dC6Df2KTHXP02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Flocations&si;=5056637515071488π=134efae9-f729-4187-b1a2-efb07d53ab22 ), a product that answers the question of which parts of a city have desirable Airbnb listings for you. We built systems that allowed writers, translators, and photographers all over the world to collaborate on bringing cities to life.

------------------------------

Seattle Engineering Positions:
------------------------------


Frontend Engineers
Working closely with designers, we implement the user interface of our web app. We build libraries and abstractions to make our lives easier, such as O2, our front-end toolkit. We make the most of modern tools like React, ES6, and SASS, and we ensure our UIs work well on all screen sizes. Some of us specialize in CSS, some in front-end infrastructure, but all of us are JavaScript pros and generalist engineers.
Backend Engineers
We are responsible for the architecture, development and scaling of backend systems that power Airbnb. Our goals include scaling and architecting systems to support advanced product features that may not be currently viable because of hard technical considerations. System uptime and availability are a priority for the team.
Machine Learning Engineers
We own challenging data problems related to auto-detecting user issues, intelligent routing, real-time optimization across multiple contact channels, and more. We build machine learning infrastructure and models in collaboration with data scientists to build software that can solve problems better and faster than humans.
Full Stack Engineers
We operate at all levels of the stack: we’re responsible for the UIs that thousands of CX agents use daily, the APIs and vendor integrations to process tickets and channel communications, the reporting pipelines to ensure data integrity and allow teams to operate, and more.

Are you an experienced Developer looking for a growth company in a hot market? Are you interested in developing cutting-edge technology that delivers live video streaming over the Internet?

If you have watched the last several Olympics, the SuperBowl, EPL soccer, NASCAR, PGA or other major live events, you’ve witnessed firsthand how this company is powering the next generation live OTT workflow!

We are looking for a Middle Tier / Back-End Web Developer to help enable advanced broadcast TV workflows in the context of over-the-top (OTT) video delivery.
