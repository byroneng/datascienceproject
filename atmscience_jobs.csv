The Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Boulder, Colorado and the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) have an immediate opening for a research associate within NOAA/ESRL Global Systems Division. The scientist will develop verification techniques and tools that quantify errors in numerical weather prediction models. Importantly, these tools will also provide insights into forecast-error attribution by identifying physical states in numerical models that are associated with systematic errors, thereby facilitating efforts improve land-surface, boundary-layer, and cloud parameterizations. The tools developed will be used to develop the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) suite of physical parameterizations, currently utilized for operational weather forecasting, and also a candidate physics suite for the Next-Generation Global Prediction System. The HRRR physics suite is under intensive development to become fully scale-aware, providing detailed storm-scale guidance at grid spacing of order 1 km or less as well as broader mesoscale structures at coarser resolutions, and will be appropriate for deterministic and ensemble modeling frameworks.

The scientist in this position will also be working within NOAA’s Atmospheric Science for Renewable Energy team on collaborative projects with the Department of Energy and other divisions within ESRL. These projects may include the Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP) and the Solar Forecast Improvement Project (SFIP). The primary role of GSD scientists within these projects is to develop the HRRR physics suite in order to provide improved meteorological guidance for renewable-energy applications.

Note: Just to be on safe side, we want to clarify this is not a GIS Administrator or application Developer role. We need experience in using the GIS Systems to produce data solutions.


To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage, mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.


Our analysts will be on teams that through facilitated analysis, work shoulder-to-shoulder with them to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture, then working very closely with their staff or system integrator to rapidly implementing that change or agile release. Furthermore, we devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results. This is what we do – we bring transformations to life.


At times, you'll work directly with and get domain guidance from our Architecture lead and report to our Chief Architect who have both been significant Government change agents for multiple decades. Both enjoy mentoring, collaboration, and making appropriate decisions and as quite familiar with these client strategies, tactics, protocols, and solutions that will be successful. Our client base enjoys the value these two bring, and have made repeated requests for support for them and their teams over the years.


Our goal for this interaction is not only quality assurance. Our application developers consistently over the years write us after they have 'graduated' and moved on saying ""I would have never learned these skills if it wasn't for your architecture mentoring approaches"". If you are looking to be invested in, can balance humility and excellence, you will truly enjoy working on our projects.

The concept of the UFO is based on modularizing components of current data assimilation (DA) systems (e.g. the GSI) toward producing the model equivalent of observations using input model background field. The modularized components include both the preprocessing of satellite observations (ingest, quality control), as well as ingest of model background information, and interfaces to the forward model (e.g. CRTM) for computing the background simulations. The modular UFO will allow for assessment of satellite bias and error characteristics as well as the ability to interface with various DA solvers (3D/4DVAR, EnKF, Hybrid schemes).
You will collaborate with JCSDA and its partners at NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA Office of Atmospheric Research, (OAR), NASA, and U.S. Department of Defense.

Develop new or leverage existing approaches for satellite data thinning, superobbing, and quality control
Develop software for the collocation of model background fields to satellite observations and interfacing to radiative transfer models or other forward operators, as well as means for comparing and assessing satellite observations and model-equivalent fields (e.g. diagnostics)
Interact and coordinate with data assimilation teams and radiative transfer model developers across the JCSDA partners and external research community
Develop documentation and technical reports for relaying progress to JCSDA management

Requirements:

Masters degree in atmospheric sciences, applied mathematics, computer science or related field is required

Experience with Linux platform in a high performance computing (HPC) environment, including shell scripting, and configuration/optimization of batch jobs
Experience with software version control such as Subversion, git, etc.
Experience with unit testing methodology and tools
Experience with collaborative software development platforms (Atlassian or other) is desired
Experience with forecast model and satellite data input formats (GRIB, BUFR, HDF5, NetCDF4 etc.) is preferred
Experience with remote sensing and/or data assimilation would be an advantage

The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.


The Office of Research and Development (ORD) mission is to conduct leading-edge research and foster the sound use of science and technology to fulfill EPA’s mission to protect human health and safeguard the natural environment. This includes the need to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. The National Academy of Science (NAS) made several recommendations in their 2003 report, “Air Emissions from Animal Feeding Operations,” on how to improve estimating animal feeding operation (AFO) emissions. One short-term recommendation was for EPA and USDA to initiate and conduct a coordinated research program designed to produce a scientifically sound basis for measuring and estimating AFO air emissions. Another recommendation was that EPA and USDA ultimately use process-based modelling to estimate air emissions from AFOs.


These recommendations resulted in ORD researchers developing methodologies and in some cases, innovative technologies to collect air emissions data at AFOs. This work was primarily conducted within two branches in the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division. The selected candidate shall work directly with EPA researchers within these two branches, the Emissions Characterization & Prevention Branch and the Atmospheric Protection Branch. Researchers within these branches develop instrumentation and methodologies to collect the data necessary to characterize and mitigate air pollution sources. Many of the methodologies developed within these two branches were applied in the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS).


In 2005, EPA entered into a voluntary administrative consent agreement (Air Compliance Agreement) with a large number of AFO owners and operators to address AFO air emissions. This Agreement and the associated National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS) addressed some of NAS’s short-term research recommendations. However, it did not address the recommendation to develop a process-based model. The Agreement stated “EPA’s long-term strategy involves additional recommendations from the NAS which entail developing a process-based model that considers the entire animal production process. The data collected in the NAEMS will lay the groundwork for developing these more process related emission estimates. However, as with any large and complex effort, this work must be conducted over a period of years.”


Agreement participants funded the NAEMS and an independent third-party Science Advisor to conduct the field work with EPA oversight. The study measured emissions from representative broiler, egg-layer, swine and dairy AFOs located across the United States. In the Agreement, EPA committed to develop emission estimating methodologies (EEMs) using NAEMS and other relevant data, and the participants agreed to use these methodologies to estimate emissions for purposes of complying with applicable Clean Air Act permitting and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) reporting requirements.


The NAEMS began in June 2007, concluded in early 2010, and all of the NAEMS data was submitted to EPA by August 2010. After the data was organized and analyzed, efforts were initiated to document the findings in a series of reports. In early 2012, the Agency submitted documents containing the draft EEMs for broiler confinement houses and swine and dairy open sources (lagoons and basins) to the Science Advisory Board (SAB) for review. The SAB submitted its final report and recommendations to the Agency in April 2013. EPA reviewed the SAB’s report and believes that the majority of the recommendations can be incorporated into the current statistical approach that was used to develop the first set of draft EEMs.


The development of EEMs, applicable to the majority of the farming practices used across the county needs to be completed to the satisfaction of the SAB and the Agency program offices being impacted by AFO emissions. The selected candidate shall assist EPA researchers in the development of EEMs that are acceptable to all parties concerned.


The selected candidate shall provide data management and data analysis in support of the SAB recommendations. These support roles are described below:


Area 1: Database Assistance


The NAEMS project was managed by a research team at Purdue University and has accumulated years of data collected from a variety of farming practices. All of this data is now in the possession of the EPA and will be the focus for the selected candidate and his/her mentor. He/she shall assist EPA technical staff in defining the strengths and weaknesses of this data for modeling purposes. Since the NAEMS research project ended, AFO research has continued at many universities and both the selected candidate and the mentor shall collaborate with other AFO researchers across the country to understand what data has been generated since the NAEMS project ended and acquire data that will assist in the development of EEMs. This work is being conducted by ORD staff in support of EPA program office required deliverables.


Area #2: Development of Emission Estimating Methodologies


The selected candidate shall assist the EPA researchers in the development of EEMs for the various farming practices for which data was collected and respond specifically to comments provided by the SAB. Additional tasks shall include the application of EEMs to farming practices included in the NAEMS project and other practices not included in the NAEMS project. The EEMs developed are important because these methods will represent the means by which the Agency develops the AFO inventories in the future.


Location: This job will be located at EPA’s Research Triangle facility in Raleigh-Durham, NC.


Salary: The selected applicant will become a full time temporary employee of ORAU and will receive an hourly wage of $20.65 for hours worked.

The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.


The Office of Research and Development (ORD) mission is to conduct leading-edge research and foster the sound use of science and technology to fulfill EPA’s mission to protect human health and safeguard the natural environment. This includes the need to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. The National Academy of Science (NAS) made several recommendations in their 2003 report, “Air Emissions from Animal Feeding Operations,” on how to improve estimating animal feeding operation (AFO) emissions. One short-term recommendation was for EPA and USDA to initiate and conduct a coordinated research program designed to produce a scientifically sound basis for measuring and estimating AFO air emissions. Another recommendation was that EPA and USDA ultimately use process-based modelling to estimate air emissions from AFOs.


These recommendations resulted in ORD researchers developing methodologies and in some cases, innovative technologies to collect air emissions data at AFOs. This work was primarily conducted within two branches in the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division. The selected candidate shall work directly with EPA researchers within these two branches, the Emissions Characterization & Prevention Branch and the Atmospheric Protection Branch. Researchers within these branches develop instrumentation and methodologies to collect the data necessary to characterize and mitigate air pollution sources. Many of the methodologies developed within these two branches were applied in the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS).


In 2005, EPA entered into a voluntary administrative consent agreement (Air Compliance Agreement) with a large number of AFO owners and operators to address AFO air emissions. This Agreement and the associated National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS) addressed some of NAS’s short-term research recommendations. However, it did not address the recommendation to develop a process-based model. The Agreement stated “EPA’s long-term strategy involves additional recommendations from the NAS which entail developing a process-based model that considers the entire animal production process. The data collected in the NAEMS will lay the groundwork for developing these more process related emission estimates. However, as with any large and complex effort, this work must be conducted over a period of years.”


Agreement participants funded the NAEMS and an independent third-party Science Advisor to conduct the field work with EPA oversight. The study measured emissions from representative broiler, egg-layer, swine and dairy AFOs located across the United States. In the Agreement, EPA committed to develop emission estimating methodologies (EEMs) using NAEMS and other relevant data, and the participants agreed to use these methodologies to estimate emissions for purposes of complying with applicable Clean Air Act permitting and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) reporting requirements.


The NAEMS began in June 2007, concluded in early 2010, and all of the NAEMS data was submitted to EPA by August 2010. After the data was organized and analyzed, efforts were initiated to document the findings in a series of reports. In early 2012, the Agency submitted documents containing the draft EEMs for broiler confinement houses and swine and dairy open sources (lagoons and basins) to the Science Advisory Board (SAB) for review. The SAB submitted its final report and recommendations to the Agency in April 2013. EPA reviewed the SAB’s report and believes that the majority of the recommendations can be incorporated into the current statistical approach that was used to develop the first set of draft EEMs.


The development of EEMs, applicable to the majority of the farming practices used across the county needs to be completed to the satisfaction of the SAB and the Agency program offices being impacted by AFO emissions. The selected candidate shall assist EPA researchers in the development of EEMs that are acceptable to all parties concerned.


The selected candidate shall provide data management and data analysis in support of the SAB recommendations. These support roles are described below:


Area 1: Database Assistance


The NAEMS project was managed by a research team at Purdue University and has accumulated years of data collected from a variety of farming practices. All of this data is now in the possession of the EPA and will be the focus for the selected candidate and his/her mentor. He/she shall assist EPA technical staff in defining the strengths and weaknesses of this data for modeling purposes. Since the NAEMS research project ended, AFO research has continued at many universities and both the selected candidate and the mentor shall collaborate with other AFO researchers across the country to understand what data has been generated since the NAEMS project ended and acquire data that will assist in the development of EEMs. This work is being conducted by ORD staff in support of EPA program office required deliverables.


Area #2: Development of Emission Estimating Methodologies


The selected candidate shall assist the EPA researchers in the development of EEMs for the various farming practices for which data was collected and respond specifically to comments provided by the SAB. Additional tasks shall include the application of EEMs to farming practices included in the NAEMS project and other practices not included in the NAEMS project. The EEMs developed are important because these methods will represent the means by which the Agency develops the AFO inventories in the future.


Location: This job will be located at EPA’s Research Triangle facility in Raleigh-Durham, NC.


Salary: The selected applicant will become a full time temporary employee of ORAU and will receive an hourly wage of $20.65 for hours worked.

The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.


The ORD National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) Human Exposure and Atmospheric Modeling Division (HEASD) focuses on conducting research to produce high-quality methods, measurements, and models needed to understand processes and factors that impact relationships between environmental pollutant sources and concentrations, human exposure and dose. HEASD scientists seek to understand where, when, how often, and why people are exposed to environmental contaminants. Tools, products and data developed by HEASD researchers provide EPA program and regional offices, states and local communities and tribes with science-based information to inform decision making.


HEASD is conducting research to develop web-based community assessment tools within ORD’s Safe and Healthy Communities Research Program (SHCRP). We are seeking a recent graduate with a Master’s Degree to assist with developing and refining C-FERST (Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool) and Tribal-FERST (Tribal-Focused Environmental Risk and Sustainability Tool). The Associate will provide scientific, technical and administrative support for developing and managing the C-FERST and T-FERST tools, which include GIS (geographic information systems), IT (information technology) and scientific databases that support those tools. Also, the Associate will provide support for the enhancement of communication, outreach, training and technology transfer. This research is covered under “Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) – Development of ORD/NERL’s Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (C-FERST) and Tribal-Focused Environmental Risk and Sustainability Tool (Tribal-FERST)” (dated: June 13, 2013). Additional activities include:

Develop an understanding of how C-FERST and other decision support tools are used by EPA, the EPA Regions, and communities.
Develop and implement recommendations on how these EPA web-based decision support tools for community assessment could be improved (e.g., through increased harmonization/integration, accuracy, coverage, efficiency, “user-friendliness” and impact/effectiveness).
Assist in Agency outreach and integration of CCAT (Community Cumulative Assessment Tool) and enhanced integration with HIA (Health Impact Assessment).
Incorporate tools for citizen science, cumulative risk, and vulnerable populations; incorporate results from environmental and exposure models; apply decision analysis tools.
Communications

Respond to public requests for information on or assistance with C-FERST.
Update website content using Drupal.
Assist with C-FERST demos and training.
Assist in the logistics and coordination activities for briefings, meetings, workshops, and other collaborative efforts.
Assist the team in developing oral presentations results and impacts using graphics and other interactive formats.
Administration

Provide administrative assistance in the development and operation of an internal (EPA) C-FERST Steering Committee to identify future content and functionality needs.
Maintain records of meetings, correspondence, and action documents.
Maintain a system to track projects in progress.
