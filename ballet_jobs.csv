Recent commissions include Tobias Picker's Piano Quintet ""Live Oaks,"" Vijay Iyer's Piano Quintet, Richard Lavenda's String Quintet ""Afterimages,"" Kaija Saariaho's Sombre and Jason Moran's The Rauschenberg Project: Holed Up .

Houston Chronicle describes Da Camera as ""a Houston gem with a unique niche in the city's milieu of performing arts,"" with critical acclaim also shared by The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , Chamber Music , Time Out/New York , Inside Arts and The Washington Post . Through innovative, thematic and curated programs, dynamic outreach activities and artist residencies, Da Camera shepherds musical excellence of uncompromising artistic standards with deeply rooted community programs that reach over 20,000 Houstonians annually, striving to make great music accessible to all.

Da Camera was invited to present Marcel Proust's Paris , the first of its Music and the Literary Imagination programs created by Sarah Rothenberg, at New York's Great Performers at Lincoln Center series in 1995; the success resulted in a Lincoln Center series for the next four years, as well as the co-commissioning of Moondrunk , a chamber music/dance theater piece which was hailed in New York as ""the birth of a new genre."" Da Camera programs have also traveled to Washington's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, London's Barbican Centre and to other prestigious concert series and festivals in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. In 2014, Da Camera launched the Jason Moran Homecoming Residency , a multi-year residency with acclaimed Houston native jazz pianist and composer Jason Moran, focused on an exploration of the interconnected relationships between jazz, neighborhood, community and visual art, which included the world premiere of Moran's The Rauschenberg Project : Holed Up . Da Camera's most recent original production, A Proust Sonata , premiered in February at Houston's Wortham Theater Center. Other programs have traveled to Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Barbican Centre and to other prestigious concert series and festivals in the U.S., Mexico and Europe.

2015 saw the release of two major international recordings: Da Camera's unique Music for Rothko Chapel program featuring Morton Feldman's Rothko Chapel and works of Satie and John Cage, on the prestigious European label ECM; and an all-Kaija Saariaho disc on Ondine featuring the Da Camera-commissioned Sombre . Previous recordings include Heartsounds: The Chamber Music of George Tsontakis on the Koch label and a disc of chamber works by American composer Charles Wuorinen, including the Da Camera-commissioned Ashberyana , on Naxos. Another Da Camera commission, Tobias Picker's Quintet, performed by Sarah Rothenberg and the Brentano String Quartet, appears on the 2014 CD Invisible Lilacs on the Tzadik label.

In 2009, Da Camera of Houston launched the Young Artist Program, a professional development program for instrumentalists, singers and composers. Providing career-expanding experiences and training to the next generation of artists, the Young Artist Program encourages them to advocate for music in the community throughout their careers. Da Camera Young Artists form the core artist-teachers who lead Da Camera's innovative Music Encounters in classrooms throughout Houston. Young Artist performances are presented by Da Camera in concert halls, museums, galleries, public schools, hospitals and even nightclubs.

The recipient of numerous awards, Da Camera was awarded three of the National Endowment for the Arts' coveted American Masterpieces: Three Centuries of Artistic Genius grants. A three-time winner of Chamber Music America/ASCAP's Adventurous Programming Award, in 2007 Da Camera was chosen by its peers to receive the CMAcclaim National Award in recognition of the organization's ""significant and lasting contribution to the cultural life of its region.""

Organization

Kentucky College of Art and Design
Starting with a grassroots program offering artist lectures, workshops, and art
appreciation classes, Louisville native Churchill Davenport planted the seeds
of what would become the Kentucky College of Art and Design in response
to Louisville’s need for an undergraduate college of art, leveraging
momentum and excitement in the city’s thriving arts community. From this
community, a core group of advocates formed, dedicated to championing the
cause of a college of art in Louisville. After an initial year of research and
discussion related to a possible new school, a feasibility study was conducted
that revealed the need and support for a college of art and design in
Louisville. Concurrently, the core group assembled further professional
artists, local supporters of the arts, and Louisville business leaders to form a
Board of Trustees, as well as a National Advisory Board consisting of several
art and academic leaders from across the country. In order to begin, they
needed an existing university as a partner during the initial stages before the
program could stand on its own. Spalding University, with its commitment to
service and experiential learning seemed the obvious choice. When
approached, Spalding University President Tori Murden McClure was
intrigued by the opportunity to help launch an art college that would one day
be independent. The hard work of the Board, two faculty members, a lean
staff, and dedicated volunteers was fruitful and Spalding University opened
the Kentucky School of Art with nine students in 2009. The vast majority of
the founding group are still intimately involved in building and advancing the
art and design school, a testament to the sustained passion for this project.
After the school grew to over 140 students in 2015, the university renamed it
the Kentucky College of Art and Design (KyCAD). Under the guidance,
leadership, and support of Spalding University, KyCAD (pronounced “kai-
cad”) is now an innovative center for art that welcomed 65 incoming
freshmen this year. This year’s entering class represents 28% of Spalding
University’s traditional first year entering class.
KyCAD’s curriculum is marked by a commitment to the development of
creative vision, innovation, leadership, and social responsibility. The course
of study combines the essential principles of the Foundation Program with
the cutting-edge techniques of Digital Media. The Foundation Program
endows students with a core from which all advanced courses in Digital
Media, Drawing, Color and Design, Illustration, Graphic Design,
Interdisciplinary Sculpture, Painting, Photography, and Printmaking are
offered. Areas of study are Digital Media, General Fine Arts, Graphic
Design, Interdisciplinary Sculpture, and Painting and Drawing, with
concentrations in Pre-Art Therapy and Illustration. KyCAD’s semesters are

Position Specification – Dean, Kentucky College of Art and Design
Page 3

divided into three six-week periods with a week break in between. This
allows students to focus more intensely on two to three classes at a time to
be truly immersed in the subject and affords students needed scheduling
flexibility amidst other life responsibilities.
KyCAD’s strong curriculum is made possible by the learner-centered,
individual focus that faculty create. The college’s faculty members are
dedicated educators and artists who emphasize the importance of nurturing
every student’s potential. In this intimate and interdisciplinary learning
environment, KyCAD’s faculty prioritize working with each student as
he/she develops. Interaction between administration, faculty, and students is
encouraged and frequent, and the entire community has a collaborative and
hands-on approach toward learning. The culture of the organization is geared
toward allowing for the flexibility and experimentation that is necessary for
creativity.
Both curricular and co-curricular programs are designed to develop the
whole student—from creative vision and intellectual capacity to the
development of professional skills, confidence, and personal integrity.
KyCAD emphasizes the importance of resource allocation and awards studio
space for most students as freshman and sophomores, as well as to all juniors
and seniors. The college is actively working to develop a robust study abroad
program and requires students to complete an internship in the junior or
senior year to help ensure job placements as KyCAD graduates.
KyCAD students benefit from all of the amenities provided to Spalding
students. This includes on-campus housing and Spalding’s commitment to
affordable tuition. Approximately 95% of KyCAD students receive some
combination of financial support through private scholarships, government
aid, and institutional student aid. For the 2015-16 school year, KyCAD will
award $616,000 in scholarship funds.

Urban Development through a commitment to local
landscape and local talent, and by serving as a local
catalyst: Drawing in creative people with an eye toward growth, art
schools prepare cities for demonstrable cultural change. Galleries, public art
installations, specialty programs—all these developments and more enrich a
city’s landscape. KyCAD believes a thriving artistic culture energizes and
intrigues people, and results in a thriving economy and an engaged populace.
To this end, the college educates artists and designers locally, growing the
city’s existing assets. As part of Spalding University, KyCAD is contributing
to a period of dynamic physical growth and change in SoBro, Louisville’s
“South of Broadway” district. Expanding green space, galleries and studios
are but a few of the current initiatives in progress.

in a rural setting. A city where Midwestern values meet Southern charm,
Louisville has a vibrant culture and attractive cost of living, for which it is
recognized as one of America’s most livable cities.
There is a dynamic and vigorous tradition of independent music, art, and
small business in Louisville. This is a place where citizens can make
demonstrable change and build for the future. The creative community in
Louisville is supportive, the palpable energy is motivating, and the resources
are growing every day. As described in the core values, KyCAD believes that
supporting and strengthening the city of Louisville is central to its mission
and to the college’s future. KyCAD plays a strategic role in community and
city development, with a focus on nearby neighborhoods and on efforts that
impact art and culture.
Boasting a thriving arts scene amidst renowned parks and natural
surroundings, it is also one of the most vital dining and cultural destinations
in the Midwest. There is a rich concentration of historical and contemporary
art exhibited at the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft, the recently
expanded Speed Museum, which is also home to the newly opened Speed

Cinema, and 21c Museum. 21c Museum is part of the 21c Museum Hotel in
Louisville, the flagship enterprise for a chain of six boutique hotels that work
to integrate art into life and travel. Louisville additionally has a vibrant gallery
scene, with a first Friday trolley hop that connects downtown galleries and
businesses. The city is home to the 12th oldest opera company in the country:
the Louisville Ballet, Louisville Orchestra, numerous independent theatres,
and the Actors Theatre of Louisville, which hosts the Humana Festival of
New American Plays. The city also hosts the Derby Festival, Forecastle
Music Festival, Gonzofest, and World Fest, and is home to the Nulu district,
the historic Highlands, and Waterfront Park. The ongoing addition of
dedicated bicycle lanes throughout the city makes it easy to access the
nightlife of 4th Street Live and the newly opened Big Four Pedestrian Bridge
connecting downtown Louisville to southern Indiana. Old Louisville,
adjacent to the school, is the host to Shakespeare in the Park and the St.
James Court Art Show. Travelers come to Louisville to experience visual and
performing art, outdoor adventure, the trendy food scene, and entertainment
of all kinds.
Further, 60% of all cities in the continental United States are within one day’s
drive of Louisville, a fact that has contributed to the city’s long held position
as a shipping hub. Hop in the car or bus, and you are within a half-day drive
to Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Nashville, Asheville, and
other exciting destinations.

Opportunities and Challenges

Kentucky College of Art and Design is evolving and actively building on the
growth it has already achieved. Progressing from a lecture program to a
burgeoning school of art and design, the student population continues to
grow. The KyCAD community has goals beyond mere growth in numbers.
The initial dream shared by artists, community leaders, and Spalding
University of an independent college of art and design in Louisville that will
lead the city, region, and the nation in art and design is still very much alive.
Spalding University is currently undergoing a standard accreditation review
that will conclude in 2017. Following this process, the new Dean will actively
work to make KyCAD a fully independent college through the accreditation
process with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Long-term
goals also include accreditation through the National Association of Schools
or Art and Design (NASAD) and membership in the Association of
Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD).

Position Specification – Dean, Kentucky College of Art and Design
Page 7

This is a seminal and exciting time for KyCAD as the organization seeks to
establish itself as an autonomous institution focusing on shaping future
leaders in the field of art and design. A new Dean will be charged with
spearheading this process and managing KyCAD’s transition from a college
within Spalding University to a separate organization, anticipated no later
than 2022. Once established and fully independent, KyCAD’s development
and evolution does not end. The college will need a leader with creativity,
drive, and vision to build on KyCAD’s strengths while nurturing the
organization to new heights of pioneering art and design education by going
beyond the expected and challenging the status quo. This trailblazer will be
an innovator and entrepreneur tasked with collaborating with senior
leadership to create the narrative for a new chapter in KyCAD’s history while
helping to provide a concrete framework for the college. The Dean should
also be deeply well versed in artistic and creative practice, exhibiting an ability
to infuse that knowledge into administrative expertise for the purpose of
educating young artists, designers, scholars, and educators.
KyCAD is poised to be an effective cultural incubator and a leader in art and
design higher education. KyCAD’s Board is composed of successful,
accomplished, and capable volunteer leaders who are steadfast in their
commitment to the college. With additional support from Louisville, local
community leaders, and Spalding University, the Dean has an opportunity to
catalyze true transformational growth within the organization and continue
to build a college that will help shape the futures of generations of the
nation’s artists. Rigor and focus will be needed to help build on the college’s
existing strengths while preparing for growth and capitalization upon new
opportunities.
Philanthropic support for the organization is robust and the organization has
already raised $3.5 million toward an $8 million campaign. Currently, as a
college within Spalding University, KyCAD has its own 501(c)(3) status,
which allows for effective fundraising.

Position Concept and Reporting Relationship

The Dean, Kentucky College of Art and Design, is the senior most executive
responsible for academic leadership and faculty development. This leader will
provide administrative direction for the college, concurrently offering
creative direction as well as the development and execution of strategic goals.
Working closely with faculty, the Board, KyCAD staff, and Spalding
colleagues, the Dean will develop and implement strategies that ensure the
long-term sustainability, unique programs, financial viability, and standing as

art community. This leader will ensure the quality of the programs by
recruiting and retaining outstanding faculty and broadly enhancing the
college’s continued emphasis on innovative art and design higher education.
The Dean will act as KyCAD’s advocate and representative, ensuring the
college becomes recognized as a leader in design education and research.

The Dean reports to the President of Spalding University, Tori Murden
McClure. President McClure became Spalding’s president in 2010 and leads
the campus through a collaborative leadership model that brings diverse
voices and experiences together through the board of trustees, Leadership
Team, and faculty and staff committees, and has overseen a campus
expansion of over 40% during her tenure. President McClure anticipates a
robust, collaborative relationship with the new Dean and seeks a partner with
a strong voice and vision for KyCAD. Such strength is fundamental, as the
person in this role will one day lead the broader efforts for independence and
ideally serve as the independent college’s president.

Of principal importance, the Dean will lead and support the faculty, with
directional oversight of other staff within the following departments: the
Office of Admissions, the Office of Institutional Advancement, and
Administration. This leader must be proficient at analyzing staffing structures

college and its entire workforce will significantly grow under the new Dean’s
leadership.

This executive will serve on President McClure’s Leadership Team and will
also work closely with Terry Tyler, current President of Kentucky College of
Art and Design; Chancellor Churchill Davenport; and the Board.
