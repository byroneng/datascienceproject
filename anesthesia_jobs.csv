NCSU was recently ranked third nationally among veterinary institutions. We foster a collegial and educational atmosphere that prioritizes patient comfort and state-of-the-art veterinary medical care.

The current ECC team includes four ACVECC diplomates (two also ACVIM diplomates and one ACVA diplomate), two clinical ER veterinarians, two ECC /dialysis fellows, four ACVECC residents, two ECC interns, 25 ECC technicians (3 are VTS ECC ) and one blood bank technician. Small animal internal medicine residents and the 11 small animal rotating interns also participate significantly in the care of ECC patients. The ECC service is supported and collaborates with all the specialty services to provide excellence in patient care. The specialty services include: internal medicine, neurology and neurosurgery, soft tissue and oncological surgery, cardiology, medical and radiation oncology, bone marrow transplant, hemodialysis, ophthalmology, diagnostic imaging (Radiology, US, CT, MRI ), nutrition, orthopedic surgery, pharmacy, clinical and anatomic pathology, family counseling, anesthesiology, dermatology, rehabilitation, behavior, exotics and avian medicine. The ECC service is also supported by an onsite feline blood donor program as well as a community based canine blood donor program.

The ECC services operate within the Randall B. Terry Companion Animal Veterinary Medical Center; an 110,000 square foot state-of-the-art teaching hospital that opened its doors in June 2011. The facility is uniquely qualified to treat patients with the most complicated medical conditions. Last year, our annual caseload was approximately 33,000 patient visits, of which approximately 3,200 were small animal ER visits and 1,100 were ICU admissions. The ICU and ER services are closely integrated yet separate services that are joined by a central conference room with good visual observation of the patient areas. The isolation area is connected to the ER area and also has good visual surveillance through glass walls. Supporting equipment and facilities in the ECC area includes a full stat lab, surgical suite, radiology suite, client visitation room, three ventilators, two point of care ultrasound units, coagulation assays (PT/aPTT, three tTEG analyzers and a platelet aggregometer), hemodialysis and plasmapheresis unit, telemetry ECG , three banks of oxygen cages and two specially designed critical care cages.

Raleigh, Wake County, and the Research Triangle Park are frequently included at the top of national and international rankings from publications such as Money, Forbes, and Bloomberg as being a great place to raise a family and succeed in business. The area attracts many talented young people looking to further their careers with advanced training and advancement opportunities. NC State University is uniquely positioned next to two other world class universities and medical schools (University of NC and Duke University). The Triangle area is also home to numerous high-tech companies and biomedical enterprises that offer collaborative research opportunities. The Raleigh-Durham International Airport is conveniently located 10 minutes from the NC State College of Veterinary Medicine. A 2013 Census estimated the population of the Triangle region (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, surrounding towns and cities) at over 2 million. This diverse and well-educated population is the basis for the robust referral caseload at the NC State Veterinary Hospital.

The incoming dentist will join the Division’s clinical and research enterprise amidst an exciting time of growth and change, marked by our transition into the brand-new, state-of-the art, $272 million and 450,000 square foot hospital expansion project which opened in October 2014.The incoming pediatric dentist will participate as a respected dental colleague within a large multi-disciplinary medical team and help to create a world class pediatric dentistry residency program. Working in concert with the Chief and the unique attributes of our pediatric dentistry program will create a lasting and large scale impact on the future of pediatric dentistry.Integrated/multi-disciplinary medical and dental careWhile there are many pediatric programs in the nation with similarly impressive standings, a distinguishing aspect of Nemours/AIDHC is the system wide prevalence of multi-disciplinary health care teams, including clinicians, dentists, clinical extenders, and skilled technicians. Pediatric dentists at Nemours/AIDHC participate as integral members of the medical team with regard to the integrated management of complex medical, developmental, behavioral, and restorative needs of patients requiring a wide range of medical care.Pediatric Dental HomeNemours/AIDHC is a long term supporter of the American Association of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) concept of a dental home for all infants, children, adolescents, and people with special health care needs (aka Pediatric Dental Home). Strong clinical evidence exists for the efficacy of early professional dental care complemented with caries-risk assessment, anticipatory guidance, and periodic supervision. Nemours/AIDHC leadership agrees that the founding of a Dental Home may follow the medical home model as a cost effective and higher quality health care alternative to emergency care cases.Multi-Disciplinary health careMany pediatric programs dissuade parents from pursuing regular, non-emergent dental care for their children due to a disconcerting location or an outdated sprawl of disjointed facilities. In contrast, the Nemours/AIDHC is a cutting edge, family accommodating facility beneficially located on the exquisite 300 acre grounds of the Nemours Mansion and Gardens located within a short drive of safe, economical, family focused communities.Those receiving medical and/or dental care at Nemours/AIDHC benefit from the ability to schedule multiple provider examinations during the course of a single visit. The Nemours/AIDHC Dental Care Center provides conventional dental care in children with a wide range of medical complexities via large, teaching friendly operatories consisting of 6 chairs in the aggregate. Approximately 5,000 dental patient visits occur each year at Nemours/AIDHC, a number which is expected to grow dramatically in the near future. An experienced Sedation Team from the Department of Anesthesiology provides consistent and high quality care for outpatients in our Dental Care Center, and as needed in our surgical suite.Treating complex medical conditionsIn parallel with the massive clinical base amassed by Nemours/AIDHC since its founding in the mid-20th Century, Nemours/AIDHC has become an international referral center for children with complex medical issues including oncological and blood disorders, organ failure (heart, kidney, and liver transplant), neurodevelopmental disorders, and various genetic disorders including skeletal dysplasia. While adequate dental care is important to all children, the timely and effective provision of superior dental care is very important to children with medically complex conditions. Thus, each patient at Nemours/AIDHC is treated as needed by a multi-disciplinary medical/dental team that collaborates with regular frequency regarding individualized medical and dental treatment plans.Pediatric Dentistry ResidencyThe conflux of several important factors urge the leadership at Nemours/AIDHC to contemplate the creation of a pediatric dentistry residency. The first consideration is based on the chronic nationwide shortage of available pediatric dentistry residence slots. The second consideration is in lieu of the exacerbating effect of a drastically limited number of pediatric dentistry residency programs within the 35MM person population surrounding Delaware. The third consideration is the Nemours/AIDHC demonstrated history of success as a pediatric teaching facility, which is a dependable predictor of success.Support for a Pediatric Dentistry Residency Program is extensive as evidenced by the Garrett B. Lyons, Sr., DDS Pediatric Dental Program, designed to create a specialized pediatric residency in Dentistry with particular emphasis on children with special needs.Regional dominanceThe Nemours/AIDHC, located in Wilmington, Delaware is one of the nation’s premier pediatric health care systems, providing world-class clinical care in 4 states: Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. We are the only provider of comprehensive pediatric health care in Delaware. In the latest rankings of U.S. News & World Report, Nemours/AIDHC was ranked in all 10 specialties including: oncology, cardiology & heart surgery, diabetes & endocrinology, gastroenterology & GI surgery, neonatology, neurology & neurosurgery, nephrology, orthopedics, pulmonology, and urology.About Academic Med Physician RecruitersAcademic Med is an Executive Search Firm that specializes in the recruitment of physicians for Medical Schools, Teaching Hospitals, and Children's Hospitals throughout the country.Learn more about this opportunity at www.academic-med.com/jobsJob Type: Full-time"
