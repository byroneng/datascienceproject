T he Nonreactor Nuclear Facilities Division (NNFD) within the Nuclear Science and Engineering irectorate (NSED) is seeking a Classification Analyst to join the Nuclear Research Operations Group (NRO). This position is primarily responsible for providing expertise, programmatic, and technical support to NSED in support of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Classification Program. This program is responsible for ensuring the proper interpretation and application of current DOE-approved guidance, in addition to guidance provided by other federal agencies in subject areas pertaining to NSED research and development.

This position requires decisions to be made involving technical interpretations of programmatic work for impact on classification. Therefore, it is a plus for the individual to have knowledge and expertise in the science and technology thrust areas of NSED. This requires analysis of complex scientific and engineering information including proposals, work control documents, scientific communications, and data to determine the appropriate classification in accordance with current DOE (and other)-approved guidance and recognize instances where such approved guidance is no longer adequate. The incumbent may occasionally function as a team lead or give direction to other specialists or non-exempt staff and may also act in other roles in support of NRO activities.

One of the major responsibilities for this position will be to function as the lead Derivative Classifier for NSED. There are approximately 30 NSED Derivative Classifiers (DCs) representing multiple scientific
disciplines and operational activities in NSED. This position will provide mentorship and training (as necessary) to the DCs within NSED. This position has the authority to make the formal determination on the classification and Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) that should be assigned to NSED proposals, projects, and publications based upon appropriate interpretation of DOE classification
guides/ bulletins and classification guides provided by other federal agencies.

There are no direct reports to the incumbent. This position reports to the NRO Manager, and is accountable for Information Security within NSED under the auspices of the ORNL Classification Officer.

maintaining operational awareness of the classification/UNCI issues in NSED,
evaluating the effect of new or revised classification guidance upon ongoing NSED missions,
providing guidance and leadership to all NSED DCs and UCNI Reviewing Officials so that they maintain a thorough knowledge and understanding of their area of classification authority and can competently execute their DC role within the boundaries of their charter,

training NSED DCs and UCNI Reviewing Officials as necessary, ensuring that NSED staff maintains a healthy awareness of potentially classified subject areas, their responsibilities for protecting classified information, and the resources available to them for ensuring classified information is identified and protected,

participating in the review of NSED Research Safety Summaries (RSS) and work proposals
focusing on potential information classification issues,

providing recommendations to resolve classification/UCNI issues affecting NSED mission objectives,

interpreting policies and developing procedures for NSED staff to ensure compliance with
federal requirements related to the identification of classified, UCNI and sensitive unclassified national security information,

analyzing complex scientific and engineering information and providing technical interpretations to identify the classification or controls that will be required on NSED programmatic work products or processes in order to adhere to current classification guidance from DOE and other federal agencies,

coordinating the NSED response to Incidents of Security Concern (IOSC) which may include reporting, conducting causal analyses, developing corrective action plans, and coordination of corrective actions,

coordinating the implementation of physical security measures within NSED for information security,

supporting audits and reviews and ensuring identified recommendations are completed, and, performing other NRO support activities as required to advance the NSED mission.

Other responsibilities will involve assisting the ORNL Classification Officer, including:

preparing reports, appraisals, or other information required from ORNL Classification Program,

determining what DOE classification guides or UCNI guidelines are applicable to ongoing programs in NSED,

developing and implementing NSED-specific classification/UCNI education and awareness material,

maintaining mutually beneficial relationships with classification staff in DOE/ORO, DOE/OSO and DOE/HQ who provide oversight on the ORNL classification and with classification professionals throughout the DOE/NNSA complex for interpretation of classification policy and regulation, and, other mission-appropriate duties as delegated by the ORNL Classification Officer. Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications: This position requires a Bachelor's degree in engineering, sciences, or related technical fields, plus a minimum of five years of relevant experience. This position requires the
incumbent to have a thorough knowledge of classification principles, policies and current classification/UCNI guidance, excellent analytical and interpretation ability, strong verbal and written communication skills and well-developed interpersonal relationship skills. The incumbent must also
possess an extensive understanding of the DOE Classification Program and overall mission. A minimum of five years’ experience in classification, Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI), and potentially classified subject areas, with increasing responsibilities for managing, implementing, planning, evaluating, and assessing this type of work, is needed. The successful candidate must have excellent analytical and interpretation abilities for applying current DOE classification guides in areas pertaining to NSED research and development.

Professional Expertise required:
Ability to operate independently and to prioritize work based on need and urgency.

Ability to communicate effectively and to make clear and concise oral or written presentations supporting classification determination rationale.
